One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More""Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,"" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. ""In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,"" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. ""We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,"" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls ""virtual railroads,"" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. ""If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,"" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the ""middle mile,"" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. ""A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,"" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. ""Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,"" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. ""The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,"" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. ""In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,"" said Lu. ""The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted."""

Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The ""Ironhand"" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a ""soft exoskeleton."" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove.

""It's all in order to reduce fatigue and prevent strain injuries in the long run.""The Ironhand system was developed with General Motors as a partner.Read MoreThe system consists of a backpack, which houses the power pack, and artificial tendons that connect to the glove. There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around €6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries.  According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called ""Robo-Glove,"" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries""Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,"" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.""By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.""  Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.""If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,"" says Krajcarski.

Trading shares of several leading US-listed Russian companies, such as search engine Yandex and telecom MTS, have been halted. And the Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 25, the day after the invasion.Russia could default on its debt within days""The idea that a country as large as Russia can be removed from indexes is a big deal,"" Winograd said.Read MoreIt seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon. Even for those Westerners still willing to invest in Russian assets, it's not clear what comes next.""Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds. With indexes starting to exclude Russia, it's still a wait-and-see game,"" said Mychal Campos, head of investing at Betterment.For investors looking to get exposure to emerging markets, Winograd said, each country should be looked at individually.""The name of the game will be differentiation. Don't invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,"" Winograd said. ""It's always strange to say that Argentina and South Korea are the same thing, for example. They're not."" Forget the BRICS and look at TICKS or MIST?To stick with the acronyms, the shutdown of the Russian stock market has essentially turned the BRICS into the BICS — and that could be a permanent change, said Rahul Sen Sharma, managing partner with Indxx, a global index provider. ""Will investors ever embrace Russia again? If there is no liquidity, it's a moot point. But it's also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,"" Sen Sharma told CNN Business.Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. The BRICS could become the TICKS. He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia. You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets. ""People love their acronyms,"" Sen Sharma joked.Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland —  is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine. So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.War in Ukraine has sparked a scramble for dollarsOther experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves.""A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks.

The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the sanctions included ""a far-reaching ban on new investment across the Russian energy sector with limited exceptions for civil nuclear energy and the transport of certain energy products back to the EU.""The measure will hit Russia's oil majors Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), but EU members will be still able to buy oil and gas from them, an EU source told Reuters.There will also be a total ban on transactions with some Russian state-owned enterprises linked to the Kremlin's military-industrial complex, the EU executive said.Read MoreThe bloc reached a preliminary agreement on the new sanctions on Monday, and no objections were raised before an agreed deadline.The ban on Russian steel imports is estimated to affect 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) worth of products, the Commission said.EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros, including jewelry. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned, EU sources said.The package also prohibits EU credit rating agencies from issuing ratings for Russia and Russian companies, which the Commission says will further restrict their access to European financial markets.The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank and the exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks.The EU also agreed on Tuesday to strip Russia of its ""most-favored nation"" trade status, opening the door to punitive tariffs on Russian goods or outright import bans.UK slaps 35% tariff on Russian vodkaThe UK government also announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia on Tuesday. It will ban the export of luxury goods to Russia and will introduce tariffs on Russian goods worth more than $1 billion.

As a result, Moscow will repay creditors from ""countries that are unfriendly"" in rubles until the sanctions are lifted, he said.Credit ratings agencies would likely consider Russia to be in default if Moscow misses payments or repays debt issued in dollars or euros with other currencies such as the ruble or China's yuan. A default could drive the few remaining foreign investors out of Russia and further isolate the country's crumbling economy. The default could come as early as Wednesday, when Moscow needs to hand over $117 million in interest payments on dollar-denominated government bonds, according to JPMorgan Chase. Although Russia has issued bonds that can be repaid in multiple currencies since 2018, these payments must be made in US dollars.Imminent defaultRead MoreKristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said Sunday that a Russian default is no longer ""improbable.""""Russia has the money to service its debt, but cannot access it,"" she said during an interview on CBS' Face the Nation.Last week, Fitch Ratings downgraded Russian debt, saying Moscow's willingness and ability to service its debts has been undermined and default ""is imminent."" The ratings agency also warned that Russia may attempt to repay creditors in specified countries in rubles.Analysts at Capital Economics said that a default was already reflected in the price of Russia's dollar bonds, which have crashed to trade at just 20 cents on the dollar.The interest payments due Wednesday come with a 30-day grace period. But credit ratings agencies could declare Russia to be in default before that period ends if Moscow makes clear that it does not intend to pay.Russia last defaulted on its domestic debt when the country was plunged into a financial crisis by a collapse in commodity prices in 1998. Its most recent foreign currency default came in 1918 when Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin repudiated bonds issued by the Tsarist government.What happens nextThe Russian government has borrowed relatively little. JPMorgan estimates that it had about $40 billion of foreign currency debt at the end of last year, with about half of that held by foreign investors.But the potential consequences of a default are difficult to gauge. The 2008 global financial crisis and the coronavirus pandemic showed how negative shocks can spread across the modern interconnected global financial system and economy. International banks are owed more than $121 billion by Russian entities, according to the Bank for International Settlements. European banks have over $84 billion total claims, with France, Italy and Austria the most exposed, and US banks owed $14.7 billion.Georgieva said Sunday that a financial crisis was unlikely to develop ""for now,"" saying that the exposure of Western banks was ""not systemically relevant.""Even if Moscow halts payments to foreign investors on all sovereign debt, the roughly $60 billion default — including ruble debt held overseas — would be in the same ballpark as Argentina's in 2020 — a non-event for markets.But analysts at Capital Economics warned that one major financial institution might be particularly exposed to Russian debt, which could cause broader financial contagion. A second risk is that a default could trigger missed payments by Russian companies.Vladimir Potanin, Russia's richest businessman, called last week for Moscow to ease restrictions on foreign currency so that interest could be paid on foreign bonds and loans. Otherwise, there was a risk the country could default on its entire external debt, which he estimated at about $480 billion.""For Russia, the main cost is being locked out of global capital markets, or at least higher borrowing costs for a prolonged period. But sanctions have done that anyway,"" wrote analysts at Capital Economics."

That's good news for gas prices,"New York (CNN Business)US oil prices briefly tumbled below $100 a barrel on Monday, unwinding a significant chunk of the recent spike caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Oil plunged more than 8%, touching a low of $99.76 a barrel. That means oil has lost almost roughly quarter of its value since touching a near 14-year high of $130.50 a barrel on March 6. It's the first time oil has traded below $100 since March 1.""This is one hell of a correction,"" said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Analysis.The selloff should ease fears of an energy-driven recession in the United States and, if sustained, should bring some relief to drivers dealing with record gasoline prices. Read MoreBrent crude, the world benchmark, dropped more than 7% to $104.35 a barrel in recent trading. That marks a sharp pullback from the recent peak of nearly $140 a barrel.Uber is rolling out a fuel surchargeTraders blamed Monday's losses on concerns about Covid-19 lockdowns in China and hopes for progress in negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.""You're seeing some vicious selling,"" said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst of the Americas at Kpler.Despite the recent selling, oil remains up by more than 30% on the year.What this means for gas pricesStill, the tumble back to $100 should cool off prices at the pump, which move with a lag to oil. If oil prices stay at current levels, the national average price for regular gasoline would likely dip by about 20 cents a gallon, Kloza said. That would mean gas prices are still high — and above $4 a gallon nationally — but below record highs.Gas prices have already stopped going straight up, even before Monday's sharp decline in oil. According to AAA, the national average stands at $4.33 a gallon on Monday. That's unchanged from Friday, so things seem to be leveling out — albeit basically at record highs.Why are US gas prices soaring when America barely uses Russian oil?Unfortunately, any relief at the pump may not last long.Kloza still expects gasoline prices to rise this spring and summer as demand recovers, with the national average climbing to around $4.50 a gallon. ""It's just going to be a wild ride,"" Kloza said.Ryan Fitzmaurice, energy strategist at Rabobank, similarly believes oil prices have not yet set their highest levels of the current cycle. ""Ultimately, we'll see new highs before all is said and done,"" said Fitzmaurice. ""Given how big and important Russia is, we will probably breach those all-time highs set in 2008.""Covid lockdowns in ChinaThe latest leg of the oil selloff came after China locked down Shenzhen, a major technology hub, as well as several other regions to contain its worst Covid-19 outbreak in two years. The lockdowns in China, which has a zero-tolerance Covid policy, raised fears in the energy market about slower demand from the world's No. 2 economy.""Coronavirus has taught us you cannot count on a stable outcome,"" said Kloza. ""Just when you think people are going back to normal behavior, here it comes.""Oil traders are also watching for developments in the war in Ukraine, including continued negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. A ceasefire could ease fears about a prolonged disruption in oil flows from Russia, the No. 2 oil producer in the world last year. However, energy veterans cautioned against reading too much into the headlines around negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.""I am super skeptical about any kind of negotiations having success here, period,"" said Robert Yawger, vice president of energy futures at Mizuho Securities. Yawger said even if a ceasefire were to emerge, the West is very unlikely to swiftly remove sanctions on Russia: ""Sanctions are not going to disappear anytime soon."""

India has not condemned the invasion of Ukraine and abstained from voting at the United Nations calling out Russia's aggression. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" to demilitarize and ""denazify"" the country.One person within India's security apparatus said the West understood India's position, given that it needs to keep its armed forces well supplied amid simmering territorial disputes with China.India, which imports 80% of its oil needs, usually buys only about 2% to 3% from Russia. But with oil prices up 40% so far this year, the government is looking at increasing this if it can help reduce its rising energy bill.Read More""Russia is offering oil and other commodities at a heavy discount. We will be happy to take that,"" one of the Indian government officials said.Russia could default on its debt within daysThe official added that such trade required preparatory work including transportation, insurance cover and getting the right blend of crude, but once that was done India would take Russia up on its offer.The officials, who declined to be identified, did not say how much oil was on offer or what the discount was.The finance ministry did not reply to an email seeking comment.Reuters has reported that Indian officials are trying to set up a rupee-ruble mechanism with Russia to continue bilateral trade. Russia has urged what it describes as friendly nations to maintain trade and investment ties.Apart from oil, India is also looking for cheaper fertilizer from Russia and its ally Belarus, according to one of the officials.'Complicated history'Indian officials said they could not suddenly replace Russia with other suppliers, particularly in the defense sector.India's dependence on Russia for its military hardware still runs as high as 60%, despite a significant reduction over the last decade.U.S. officials have declined to say if India would be sanctioned should Russia send S-400 missile systems as part of a $5.5 billion deal signed in 2018 for five of them.Initial supplies of the system started late last year despite a U.S. law aimed at deterring countries from buying Russian military hardware.Ely Ratner, U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs, told a U.S. Congress hearing last week that India was diversifying its defense suppliers.""We recognize that India has a complicated history and relationship with Russia. The majority of the weapons that they buy are from the Russians,"" he said.""The good news is that they are in a multi-year process of diversifying their arms purchases away from Russia -- that's going to take some time. But they are clearly committed to doing that, including the indigenization of their own defense industry and that's something we should support.""British Foreign Minister Liz Truss also said last week that London should pursue closer economic and defense ties with India to help it reduce its reliance on Russia.Since 2011, New Delhi has cut its defense imports from Russia by 53%.D.

The danger is that if radiation exposure occurs, the thyroid gland can't distinguish between regular iodine and radioiodine and will absorb both. Too much exposure can lead to thyroid cancer. When used as directed, potassium iodide in liquid or pill form can quickly saturate the thyroid gland and prevent it from absorbing radioactive iodine. Read MorePrice gouging sets in Large manufacturers of potassium iodide approved for sale in the United Sates have seen their inventories rapidly depleted in recent weeks, coinciding with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.As supplies in the market dry up, price gouging has set in.On eBay (EBAY), four boxes of Thyrosafe potassium iodide tablets were listed for $132.50 on Monday. Another listing for a box of IOSAT 130 mg pills was selling for $89.95 each. The 14-pack box of the IOSAT tablets, made by Anbex, sell for $13.99 on the manufacturer's website.Anbex is hoping to restock its inventory of IOSAT potassium Iodide tablets in the coming weeks.It's also important to know that potassium iodide pills aren't a cure-all and don't offer 100% protection against radioactive iodine. The CDC warns that a single dose protects the thyroid gland for just 24 hours.The agency said taking a higher dose, or taking it more often than recommended, does not offer more protection and can cause severe illness or death.The CDC also cautions that potassium iodide pills only protect the thyroid and work best for certain age groups.Out of stockAnbex, Inc., based in New York, is a leading supplier and produces 65 mg and 130 mg IOSAT potassium iodide tablets. Its website currently shows a message saying, ""We are currently out of stock of IOSAT potassium iodide 130mg and 65mg tablets.""""We hope to be back in stock in early April but we're pushing for late March,"" said Troy Jones, vice president of sales and marketing for Anbex. Jones also runs a website www.nukepills.com that sells Anbex's potassium iodide pills.Key supply of diamonds caught up in Russia sanctionsJones said the company saw a rush of orders beginning in mid February of up to 15 million tablets from a variety of buyers, including individuals, resellers, hospitals, municipalities and governments worldwide.""The big run started on February 23 through February 28. We sold out of all the inventory we had,"" Jones said. Although supplies are being replenished weekly, they're selling out just as fast. ""In the past five days we've probably sold as much as what typically would take us half a year to sell,"" he added.The timeline, Jones said, matched reports last month that Russian forces had seized control of Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The plant's electrical system was reportedly damaged during the attack and required repair work.Russia could default on its debt within daysHistorically, demand for potassium iodide spikes when there's a real or perceived threat of nuclear fallout, Jones said.Demand soared when former President Donald Trump tweeted in 2018 that he had a ""much bigger & more powerful"" button than North Korea's Kim Jong-un, igniting fear about an escalating threat of nuclear war. It also happened in the same year when the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency sent out a false ballistic missile alert.And just last month, Russian president Vladimir Putin said he had ordered his country's deterrence forces — which include nuclear arms — to be at their highest state of alert. The White House responded to the move, calling it part of a wider pattern of unprovoked escalations and ""manufactured threats"" from the Kremlin. The escalating rhetoric from Russia only helped fuel anxiety — and the purchase of potassium iodide, manufacturers said.Anbex, which sells its tablets in a 14- day or 20-day foil-sealed pack depending on the dosage, has ramped up production, said Jones. He said consumers should follow the CDC's guidelines and only take potassium iodide pills on the advice of health officials.BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals said demand for its Thyrosafe pills took off in February coinciding with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.London-based BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals said it's also experiencing heightened demand for the company's potassium iodide products across Europe and the US.  ""This has coincided with the conflict in Ukraine,"" said Chris Sampson, spokesperson for London-based BTG, which also has US operations. BTG makes Thyrosafe, an FDA-appoved 65 mg over-the-counter potassium iodide tablet. A box of 20 tablets is priced at $12.95 on the company's website.Sampson said BTG has not been entirely out of stock, ""though we have temporarily stopped accepting orders through our own website and some of our partners/distributors have been out of stock.""""Most of our product is sold to governments, public health agencies and the military who manage stockpiles,"" he said. ""All of those orders are being met."" The White House could not immediately be reached for comment on this story.-- CNN's Brenda Goodman contributed to this report"

","tech, Russian internet users are learning to beat Putin's internet crackdown - CNN",Russian internet users are learning how to beat Putin's internet crackdown,"(CNN Business)A digital Iron Curtain may be descending on Russia, as President Vladimir Putin struggles to control the narrative about his war in Ukraine. The Kremlin has already moved to block Facebook and Twitter, and its latest step in that direction came Friday as the government announced plans to block Instagram in the country, as well. But despite Putin's efforts to clamp down on social media and information within his borders, a growing number of Russian internet users appear determined to access outside sources and circumvent the Kremlin's restrictions.  To defeat Russia's internet censorship, many are turning to specialized circumvention technology that's been widely used in other countries with restricted online freedoms, including China and Iran. Digital rights experts say Putin may have inadvertently sparked a massive, permanent shift in digital literacy in Russia that will work against the regime for years. Since the invasion of Ukraine, Russians have been flocking to virtual private networks (VPNs) and encrypted messaging apps, tools that can be used to access blocked websites such as Facebook or safely share news about the war in Ukraine without running afoul of new, draconian laws banning what Russian authorities consider to be ""fake"" claims about the conflict.  A rapid rise in downloads Read MoreDuring the week of February 28, Russian internet users downloaded the five leading VPN apps on Apple and Google's app stores a total of 2.7 million times, a nearly three-fold increase in demand compared to the week before, according to the market research firm SensorTower.  That growth dovetails with what some VPN providers have reported. Switzerland-based Proton, for example, told CNN Business it has seen a 1,000% spike in signups from Russia this month. (The company declined to provide a baseline figure for comparison, however.)  VPN providers are just one type of application seeing higher uptake in Russia. Since March 1, a range of messaging apps including Meta's Messenger and WhatsApp services have seen a gradual increase in traffic, said the internet infrastructure company Cloudflare, a trend consistent with an increase in traffic to global social media platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok.  But perhaps the fastest-growing messaging app in Russia may be the encrypted messaging app Signal. SensorTower said Signal was downloaded 132,000 times in the country last week, an increase of more than 28% from the week before. Russian internet traffic to Signal has seen ""significant growth"" since March 1, Cloudflare told CNN Business. Other private messaging apps, such as Telegram, saw a relative slowdown in growth that week but still witnessed more than half a million downloads in that timeframe, SensorTower said. In recent weeks, Russian internet users also appear to have increased their reliance on Tor, a service that anonymizes internet browsing by scrambling a user's traffic and bouncing it through multiple servers around the world. Beginning the day of the Ukraine invasion, Tor's metrics page estimated that thousands more Russian users were accessing the web through secret servers connected to Tor's decentralized network. Tor users got a helping hand from Twitter on Tuesday, as the social network — which has been partially blocked in Russia following the invasion — added the ability to access its platform through a specialized website designed for Tor users. Facebook, for its part, has had its own Tor site since 2014.  And Lantern, a peer-to-peer tool that routes internet traffic around government firewalls, began seeing more downloads from Russia starting about two months ago, said Sascha Meinrath, a communications professor at Penn State University who sits on the board of Lantern's parent company, Brave New Software.  Lantern has seen a 2,000% increase in downloads from Russia alone over the past two months, Meinrath said, with the service going from 5,000 monthly users in Russia to more than 120,000. By comparison, Meinrath said, Lantern has between 2 million and 3 million users globally, mostly in China and Iran. ""Tor, Lantern, all the VPNs, anything that's masking who you are or where you're going —Telegram — everything, downloads are increasing dramatically,"" said Meinrath. ""And it's a bootstrapping thing, so the people that are on Telegram, they're using that to swap notes about what else you should download."" The most tech-savvy and privacy-conscious users, said Meinrath, know how to combine multiple tools together to maximize their protection — for example, by using Lantern to get around government blocks while also using Tor to anonymize their activity.  The war for information technology The growing prominence of some of these tools highlights the stakes for Russian internet users as the Kremlin has detained thousands of people for protesting the war in Ukraine. And it contrasts with the steps Russia has taken to clamp down on social media, from blocking Facebook entirely to passing a law that threatens up to 15 years behind bars for those who share what the Kremlin deems ""fake"" information about the war.  Natalia Krapiva, a lawyer at the digital rights group Access Now, said some Russian internet users have been using secure communications tools for years, as the Russian government began restricting internet freedoms more than a decade ago.  In the past, the Russian government has tried to block Tor and VPN providers, Krapiva said. But it hasn't been very successful, she said, due to Tor's open, decentralized design that hinges on many distributed servers and the willingness of new VPN providers to fill the gap left behind by banned ones. What Russia faces now is an intensifying game of cat and mouse, Krapiva said.  But while Putin may not be able to shut down censorship-resistant technologies entirely, supporters of the Kremlin can still try to drag it into Russia's wider information war and hinder adoption.  On February. 28, Signal said it was aware of rumors suggesting the platform had been compromised in a hack — a claim the company flatly denied. Without blaming Russia directly, Signal said it suspected the rumors were being spread as ""part of a coordinated misinformation campaign meant to encourage people to use less secure alternatives."" Signal's claim underscores how quickly the information war has evolved from being about the news coming out of Ukraine to being about the services people use to access and discuss that news. If only a small minority of Russians end up embracing circumvention technologies to get access to outside information, it may allow Putin to dominate the information space within the country. And while there are many indications of growing interest in these tools, it appears to be on the scale of thousands, not millions, at least for now.  ""The concern, of course, is that the majority of the people, the general population, might not necessarily know about those tools,"" said Krapiva. ""[They] can be complex if your digital literacy is quite low, so it's going to remain a challenge to have a bigger section of the population really adopt these tools. But I'm sure there will be more education and I want to remain hopeful they will persevere."" Normalizing censorship-resistant tech  Some digital rights experts say it's important for these tools to be used for ordinary and innocuous internet activities, too, not just potentially subversive ones. Performing mundane tasks like checking email, accessing streaming movies or talking to friends using these technologies makes it harder for authoritarian regimes to justify cracking down on them, and can make it more difficult to identify efforts to violate government restrictions on speech and access. ""The more that regular users use censorship-resistant technology for everyday activities like unblocking movies, the better,"" said John Scott-Railton, a security and disinformation researcher at The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab. And this may only be the start. Meinrath said the government restrictions will likely trigger not just broader adoption of circumvention tools in Russia but also further research and development of new tools by Russia's highly skilled and tech-savvy population.  ""We're at the beginning of a J-curve,"" Meinrath said, adding: ""This is a one-way transformation in Russia."""

Russia opens criminal case against Meta following temporary hate speech policy changeThe internal post, which was reported by Bloomberg and Reuters and confirmed to CNN Business by a Meta spokesperson, does not mention Russian President Vladimir Putin by name. The spokesperson affirmed that the restrictions on calls for assassination apply globally. Meta's earlier decision allows Ukrainian users to post otherwise prohibited calls for violent self-defense or condemnation of Russia's invasion, and effectively created more leeway for users in the country to express support for violence on Meta's platforms. (On Sunday, Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's Minister of Digital Transformation thanked Meta and said the decision ""respect[ed] our right to counter the aggression"" from Russia.)But Meta was forced to clarify its stance after Russia accused it of facilitating ""illegal calls for murder and violence"" against Russian citizens and opened a criminal case against the company. Russia has separately moved to block Facebook and Instagram in the country as part of a crackdown on information about the war in Ukraine, though a growing number of Russian internet users appear determined to circumvent the ban.  Read MoreThe Ukraine-specific policy on hate speech, which is temporary, is ""focused on protecting people's rights to speech as an expression of self-defense in reaction to a military invasion of their country,"" Clegg said in a public statement Friday. The statement added that Meta has ""no quarrel with the Russian people"" and that ""there is no change at all in our policies on hate speech as far as the Russian people are concerned.""Clegg's internal post on Sunday doubled down on that position.""We are now narrowing the focus to make it explicitly clear in the guidance that it is never to be interpreted as condoning violence against Russians in general,"" Clegg wrote, adding that the hate-speech carveout for Ukraine applies only to speech ""regarding the Russian military invasion."""

","tech, Why internet backbone services Cogent and Lumen are cutting off Russia  - CNN",'This is different': Why internet backbone services are cutting off Russia ,"(CNN Business)Big tech platforms have joined the global backlash against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, with Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL), Twitter (TWTR), Spotify (SPOT), Netflix (NFLX) and others placing at least partial restrictions on Russian content — if not exiting (or getting themselves blocked) altogether. In the past week, however, the severing of Russia from the global internet went one layer deeper. Two of the world's largest internet service providers, Lumen Technologies and Cogent Communications, said they would block Russian customers from their networks over fears that their networks could be used by the Russian government for cyberattacks against the West. But a knock-on effect is that it will be even harder for citizens in the country to use the worldwide web. The move highlights the tension over Russia's effort to erect what's being called a digital Iron Curtain to close its citizens off from outside information, much like China has done for years. Companies find themselves caught between helping Russians freely access the internet and ensuring their services are not used by the Russian government to spread disinformation, propaganda or worse. The implications are massive. Lumen and Cogent collectively preside over nearly 600,000 miles of optical fiber that forms the piping for the global internet, with each boasting operations in more than 50 countries, according to their websites.Fear of cyberattacksRead MoreBoth companies insist their moves were squarely directed at the Russian government and not the Russian people, and any impediment to the latter's ability to access outside information is an unfortunate side effect. ""We as a company are a very strong believer in an open and uncensored internet,"" Dave Schaeffer, Cogent's CEO, said in an interview with CNN Business. ""This was a very difficult decision."" Cogent Communications CEO Dave SchaefferAccording to Schaeffer, cutting Russia off is a preventative measure against cyberattacks that may be perpetrated through Cogent's network by the Russian government or individuals linked to it. The company, which is based in Washington D.C., has limited its action to around 25 customers that are incorporated in Russia and are directly on Russian networks, he said. That means Russian businesses that use Cogent's network outside the country through non-Russian state entities can continue to do so.""We felt that the downside of having the possibility that these connections could be used offensively outweighed the negative of terminating some services,"" he added.An unprecedented decisionLumen, headquartered in Monroe, Louisiana, cited similar reasoning for its decision, which came a few days after Cogent's. ""We decided to disconnect the network due to increased security risk inside Russia,"" Mark Molzen, the company's global issues director, said in an email. ""We have not yet experienced network disruptions but given the increasingly uncertain environment and the heightened risk of state action, we took this move to ensure the security of our and our customers' networks, as well as the ongoing integrity of the global Internet.""The digital Iron Curtain: How Russia's internet could soon start to look a lot like China'sIt's also an unprecedented decision in some ways. Schaeffer said Cogent has previously taken down certain websites and addresses at the requests of governments in several countries, including Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United States, as long as the requests have a lawful basis. ""This is different,"" he said, describing it as the first time the company has made a proactive move. ""We don't look inside of our customers' pipes, what they do with them is their business.

Begum's energy bills for her one-bedroom apartment have shot up by about £70 ($92) in the past three months, even though she's using similar amounts of fuel. She works at Tesco (TSCDF), a supermarket chain, where she has seen ""every single product"" rise in price.""Milk was 80p ($1.05). The smallest one, that's gone to £1 ($1.31),"" she said. ""The bread — the cheapest bread that we used to do for £1 — has gone to £1.20 ($1.57)."" Annual consumer price inflation hit 5.5% in January in the United Kingdom — its highest level since 1992 — fueled by product shortages and a sharp spike in demand as pandemic lockdowns were lifted. Wages aren't keeping pace.  Read MoreAverage worker pay suffered its biggest drop in more than seven years in the three months to January, falling by 1% over the same period a year ago once inflation is taken into account, the UK Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday. And the war in Ukraine has driven energy costs even higher —  gasoline and diesel prices have soared to new record highs in recent days.The Boiler House has multiple sites, including the Northwold Youth & Community Hub in east London.The Boiler House Youth and Community Space started its food pantry during the coronavirus pandemic. Unlike a traditional food bank, guests browse and shop for their own items, paying a £6.50 ($8.50) fee to receive about £35 ($46) worth of food and toiletries. But the charity's services have expanded to provide members with shoes and help paying their energy bills as many struggle with  the most severe knock to their purchasing power in years. Davina Mathurin, project officer for The Boiler House, summarized the dilemma many are facing. ""Do you either keep the house warm so [your] children don't get ill?"" she said. ""Or do [you] buy food so they can eat and they're not hungry?""Millions of people's fuel bills rose in October when Britain's energy regulator increased its consumer price cap — the maximum suppliers can charge per unit of energy — by 12% after a global natural gas supply crunch pushed wholesale prices up to record levels.A shopper carries his purchases in Walthamstow, east London, on February 13.On the day CNN Business visited in February, Mathurin had started referring some members to fuel voucher programs organized by charities that offer up to £49 ($64) to help with bills. Demand was high, she said.  Monique John, another regular visitor to the Boiler House, told CNN Business that she owns a smart meter. The device helps her conserve energy, but her money does not stretch nearly as far as it used to.  ""You just literally watch [the meter] go down and down and down and down and down,"" she said. 'There's just nothing left to give'The worst is yet to come.In April, the energy price cap will soar by 54% — its largest ever rise — burdening 22 million people with an annual bill of roughly £2,000 ($2,618). Inflation is also expected to peak above 7% and a new payroll tax to help fund health and social care will take effect. Steam and smoke is seen rising from the chimneys and central heating vents of houses in January in London.The higher costs could push the number of ""destitute"" households — defined as those unable to afford basic necessities — up by a third to hit 1 million, according to analysis by The National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month pushed wholesale gas prices up even further as global markets panicked over whether sanctions would hit Russian exports. Analysts at investment bank Investec said Britons' annual energy bills after October — the next time the price cap is adjusted — could rocket past £3,000 ($3,927) as a result. ""Now there's just nothing left to give from people's budgets. There's no way the numbers add up now,"" Lucy Bannister, policy campaigns manager at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an anti-poverty charity, told CNN Business.""Children are feeling too scared to ask for the heating to be put on,"" she added. ""They're really kind of taking on that stress that they're seeing their parents go through. Feeling hungry and not asking for a snack.""The government will try to ease the pain by cutting local taxes and allowing millions of Britons to spread the cost of their energy bills over the next few years. A government spokesperson told CNN Business that it was ""providing support worth around £12 billion ($16 billion) this financial year and next, to help households with the cost of living.""The spokesperson added that the government would raise the minimum wage by more than £1,000 ($1,309) a year and hike a benefit claimed by people on low incomes by the same amount. Both will start in April.Critics say the government's response is inadequate and fails to target those who need it most. Ian Allinson, a member of the executive committee at Manchester Trades Union Council, which organized a protest against higher costs in February, said the situation is ""alarming."" He said the government's plan to delay energy payments won't help vulnerable people.""We're appalled when the main measure the government has announced [to bring down energy bills] is that we have to give ourselves a loan,"" he told CNN Business. ""A lot of people are struggling with debt already. The idea that there's then enforced further debt rather than any genuine help is just shocking.""People march through  Manchester on February 12, as protests were held nationally against rising energy bills and the cost of living.Angry Britons are taking to the streets. Protesters, and the opposition Labour Party, have called for a windfall tax on energy companies like BP (BP) and Shell (RDSA), which made billions in profit last year. ""It's just scandalous that the government is choosing to not do something effective to support ordinary people but is happy to leave those mega profits for the companies that are inflicting this on us,"" Allinson said. Paychecks can't keep upAt a north London church, piles of groceries are laid out in a grid on the floor of a small side building. Volunteers are packing the donated items into bags before driving them to people's doors. Cooking Champions, an organization which caters for charitable groups and local businesses, started its delivery service in April 2020 after the pandemic hit. Annalisa Moseley is one of the first to receive her shopping. The mother-of-two said that without Cooking Champions, some weeks she would have no food. Thinking about what will happen after April is stressful, she said.   Volunteers at Cooking Champions in London create food parcels using donated and redistributed food.""It's all on my shoulders sort of thing to make sure the kids are warm and fed and everything,"" Moseley said. ""It has been getting me down a little bit, but just got to carry on. Keep trying.""Moseley receives Universal Credit — a benefit for people who are out of work or on low incomes. The government hiked payments by £20 ($26) a week during the pandemic, but that ended in October 2021. The benefit will increase by 3.1% in April, but that's less than half the expected rate of inflation.Rising wages can't keep up either. The Spring Community Hub, a food and clothes bank 15 miles to the south across London, runs another door-to-door delivery service. Lately, volunteers have helped increasing numbers of younger and more affluent people. ""We're seeing more working people and people on those precarious hours particularly,"" CEO Felicia Boshorin told CNN Business. ""When the actual money comes, it's not enough,"" she added.Parents are 'dreading' SeptemberSeptember looms large for parents worried about the cost of school uniforms. Shirts, sweaters and jackets emblazoned with school logos — mandatory in the United Kingdom — can run into the hundreds of pounds for a single child.One in 10 British families have fallen into debt buying items needed for school, according to a 2020 survey by The Children's Society, a charity. That figure could grow in 2022 — clothes and footwear were the biggest contributors to inflation in the month to January, according to the Office for National Statistics. Caroline Rice, who lives in Northern Ireland, is ""dreading"" the new school year. She is a member of Covid Realities, a research project documenting the experiences of low income families during the pandemic. ""I can't afford £100 ($131) for oil, so why would I pay £50 ($65), £60 ($79) for a school blazer?"" she said.Back at The Boiler House, parents are turning up with their children to browse shelves of colorful sneakers, donations provided by charity Sal's Shoes. Begum's daughter rushes over to a pair of white and pink sparkly Converse and tries them on. ""With poverty there is that loss of dignity if you're just effectively being handed handouts,"" said CJ Bowry, the founder of Sal's Shoes.Sal's Shoes' St Paul's Centre in Crewe, on February 16.Its three pop-up stores around the country aim to give ""families a shopping experience,"" she said. ""So they can visit these shops and try on shoes and choose shoes and see a selection of shoes — but they don't have to pay.""Sal's Shoes has sent nearly 3 million pairs to 54 countries in its eight years, though more and more are being sent closer to home. The charity distributed 48,000 pairs around the United Kingdom in 2021, its highest number ever. Bowry said she receives calls every day from school principals asking for support.""We have headteachers who've done playground duty and then ring us because they've literally noticed children in their playground with the soles flapping off their shoes,"" she said. 'Hardship is harder'The Bank of England expects inflation to cool after peaking in April, but high prices will stick around. For people who have taken on new debts and fallen behind on their bills, there will be a scarring effect that could last for years. Research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation last year found that 4.4 million low income households began borrowing or added to existing debts during the pandemic. Of that number, more than two thirds are behind on their repayments. Joseph De-Ville, another member of Covid Realities, lives in Cornwall with his wife and three children. He got into debt a couple of years ago to pay for his mother's funeral, and told CNN Business about the constant struggle to provide for his family.  ""This is the parts of life that people aren't seeing,"" he said. ""We're locking it up into credit cards so we can cope, and then we're struggling to pay the debts because [of] the interest rates — because we're having to take high interest rate credit cards just so we can get by."" For over a decade, real incomes and living standards for millions of Britons have dropped. For De-Ville, the rising cost of living is just the latest chapter of an extended crisis.""Hardship is harder,"" he said."

The company's white — or sometimes holiday-themed — logo-emblazoned paper cups for hot drinks, and clear plastic cups for cold drinks are instantly recognizable symbols of the brand. But that's not entirely a good thing. ""Our cup is ubiquitous, and we love that,"" said Michael Kobori, Starbucks chief sustainability officer. ""But it is also this ubiquitous symbol of a throwaway society."" That's because the cups are disposable. When they are thrown away, the cups end up in landfills or as litter in streets and waterways. Some might be recycled, but recycling is an imperfect option — recyclable items still end up in landfills.The best solution? ""Eliminating the disposable cup,"" Kobori said. He called that option ""the holy grail.""The traditional Starbucks disposable cup.Read MoreBy 2025, the company wants every customer to be able to either use their own mug easily or borrow a ceramic or reusable to-go mug from their local Starbucks. That could mean rolling out more borrow-a-mug programs that require a deposit. Starbucks is also planning, by the end of next year, to let customers use their own personal mugs at every Starbucks in the United States and Canada, even if they order ahead or use the drive-thru. The goals don't mean Starbucks will get rid of the paper and plastic cups. But they do want to make that option less attractive. That won't be easy to do, as most Starbucks customers are used to that simple, single-use option. But the company has a plan. Testing out Borrow-A-Cup programs  Examples of Starbucks' reusable cups. To phase out disposables, Starbucks is considering a widespread borrow-a-cup program, in which customers pay a deposit for a durable cup that they take with them and drop back off after use. Amelia Landers, a vice president of product experience whose team is responsible for sustainable packaging at Starbucks, expects that this model will resonate more with customers compared to other sustainability efforts. ""I think that will take the lead,"" she said. ""We are testing a number of different [borrow-a-cup] programs around the globe,"" including ""20 different iterations and in eight different markets."" In Seattle, Starbucks tested a beta version of such a program last year.""We developed a new cup that had a very low environmental footprint, was lightweight polypropylene, ultimately recyclable and could replace 100 single-use disposable cups,"" Landers explained. For that test, customers paid a $1 deposit, and had to return the cup to a smart bin located in the store to get their dollar back. Customers also earned rewards for using the cup.Kim Davis, who manages a store where the program was tested, said that customers were curious about the bin, and once baristas explained it to them, many were on board with the concept.  ""The excitement and engagement was really high among my customers and my [employees],"" she said. For baristas, the process was straightforward enough — they just used the reusable cup instead of a regular one to prepare drinks. A third-party company collected the dirty cups for cleaning, so baristas didn't have to worry about that part of the process. Starbucks (SBUX) is running similar pilot programs in Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom.The model is the most promising because it's the easiest to integrate into customers' daily lives. You don't have to remember to bring your own reusable mug or, if you do, get stuck with a dirty cup for the rest of the day. And you don't need to sit and sip your coffee at a Starbucks, something most people don't have time for on a weekday morning. But that model is still just being tested, so the company wants to encourage the use of reusable mugs in other ways. Bringing back the personal cup  Starbucks wants all customers to be able to use reusable mugs and glasses at its stores. Early in the pandemic, when people feared that the coronavirus could spread easily on surfaces, Starbucks barred customers from bringing their own mugs. It has since brought back the option and is now trying out ways to make it more attractive. ""We're testing an incentive on the personal cup to go up from where it is today — from 10 cents to 50 cents,"" Landers said. ""We are also going to be testing a disposable cup fee."" She added that the chain is also experimenting with discounted prices for people who use a Starbucks-provided ceramic mug in stores. That's simple enough. But it gets a lot more complicated when customers bring their own cups to the drive-thru or when they order ahead through the Starbucks app. Years ago, ordering ahead or using a drive-thru might have been a rare enough occasion. But since the pandemic, more customers have been coming through the drive-thru or ordering ahead.During a February analyst call, Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri said that Starbucks' drive-thru windows and its mobile orders together account for about 70% of sales at US stores operated by the company.  So to achieve its zero-disposable-cups goal, Starbucks needs to figure out how to get reusables through a drive-thru, and make them available to customers who order ahead. To that end, Starbucks has been testing different options at its innovation center. ""We've got mock stores set up,"" said Landers. ""We have different versions of the drive-thru layout."" Customers can simply give their cups to baristas at the drive-thru window. But Starbucks is exploring ways to make the process smoother. Pantene and Stubb's will be sold in reusable containers at some Kroger storesOne option is to allow customers to drop off their cups at an earlier point in the drive-thru lane so that the drink is ready in a personal cup once they swing around to the window, Landers said. Another is for baristas to pre-make drinks when customers place their orders, and pour them into personal tumblers at the window or when they arrive at a store to pick up their order. Starbucks is also testing out cup-washing stations in stores. The team is trying ""different things, over and over again,"" to figure out what might work, she said. ""We're right now in the middle of all of that work.""It's crucial for Starbucks' mobile order and drive-thru experiences to be seamless. After just a few sluggish pickups, customers may take their business elsewhere.But Starbucks also has to be careful not to put too much additional burden on employees, who already have to prepare complicated, customized orders at high speeds. That's especially important now. Workers across the country are considering unionization, going against the wishes of the company's  leadership. A Starbucks, in Buffalo, New York, was the first to vote to unionize in December. Employees at a handful of other stores have since made similar efforts and several Starbucks around the country are preparing for their own votes.If the company's initiative leads to the end of paper and plastic cups at Starbucks, it will be quite an achievement.""We know that even the most ardent of sustainability champion customers, they really don't change their behavior all that easily,"" Landers said. ""Even though they really, really want to."""

But as Covid cases in the country spike, keeping up the same pace of growth in the coming months may prove difficult.Retail sales rose 6.7% in the first two months of 2022 compared to a year ago, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Tuesday. That was well above the estimated 3% increase in a Reuters poll of economists.Industrial production jumped 7.5% during the same period, surpassing the forecast of 3.9%. And investment in fixed assets, such as infrastructure and machinery, jumped 12.2% from a year earlier.""Under the combined effect of macro policies and the efforts of businesses, the momentum of China's economic recovery has improved in January and February, laying a solid foundation for a good start in the first quarter of this year,""  said Fu Linghui, a spokesperson for the NBS, at a press conference in Beijing on Tuesday.On the policy front, China has significantly boosted its spending on infrastructure, with many local governments kicking off big projects in areas such as electric mobility and semiconductors, Fu added.Read MoreTuesday's data showed that investment in manufacturing surged 21% during January and February from a year ago, much faster than the 13.5% year-on-year growth recorded in the same period in 2021. China sets lowest economic growth target in decades as challenges mountThis is not the first time this year that Chinese authorities have underscored the importance of infrastructure expenditure. Earlier this month, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said the government would ramp up fiscal and monetary support for the economy this year, including spending more on infrastructure and conducting more interest rate cuts. The government has increased the broad fiscal deficit this year, implying growth in infrastructure investment, wrote Larry Hu, chief economist for Greater China at Macquarie Group, in a report on Tuesday. However, experts warn that there are multiple challenges on the horizon, including Covid and the war in Ukraine.China's new Covid lockdowns are another threat to the economyThe worst Covid-19 surge in two yearsChina is fighting its worst Covid surge since the original outbreak in Wuhan in early 2020.""With officials ditching targeted containment measures in favor of wholesale lockdowns, this has the potential to be even more disruptive than the Delta wave last Summer, which led to a sharp contraction in economic output,"" wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist for Capital Economics, on Tuesday. Even the government acknowledges that new Covid outbreaks could weigh on the economy in the coming months.""The recent spread of the coronavirus in many parts of the country may restrict consumption further, and the foundation of the consumption is still not strong,"" Fu said. ""Sporadic outbreaks in some regions will also affect industrial growth.""China reported 5,154 locally transmitted cases on Monday, the highest number in two years, according to the National Health Commission (NHC).To contain the spread of the virus, authorities have taken strict measures in multiple cities and placed tens of millions of people under various forms of lockdowns.Apple supplier Foxconn halts operations in Shenzhen as China locks down tech hubThe southern city of Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, has imposed a week-long lockdown since Monday. All businesses — apart from those deemed essential or engaged in supplying Hong Kong — have suspended operations or have implemented work-from-home policies. The city is home to Chinese tech giants Huawei and Tencent.Apart from Shenzhen, local authorities in the northeastern province of Jilin have banned residents from leaving or traveling since Monday. The province, with 24 million people, is home to the industrial hub of Changchun, where Toyota (TM) and Volkswagen (VLKAF) run their car factories in partnership with state-owned car maker FAW Group.Shanghai, the country's largest business center, has also imposed stringent measures after a spike in Covid cases, closing schools and cinemas and restricting travel into the city.""Indeed, Covid-19 is the biggest uncertainty this year,"" Hu from Macquarie Group said.He predicts that China will grow at 4% in the current quarter. For 2022, he expects the world's second largest economy to grow at 5%, lower than the government's target. Earlier this month, Premier Li set China's economic growth target at around 5.5% for 2022, the lowest official goal in decades.Inflation pressure from the Ukraine crisis China growth may be hit even further by the war in Ukraine.Russia's invasion of its neighbor is pushing up commodity prices and roiling the global economy, at a time when policymakers are already racing to get high inflation under control. Fu from the NBS said the direct impact of the tensions in Europe on China is ""limited,"" as its trade exposure to Russia and Ukraine is ""small.""But he said the impact on global commodity prices is ""obvious,"" which could increase the pressure of ""imported inflation"" on China.Several food and beverage companies in China have recently hiked prices of their products, including dairy giants Yili and Mengniu.""The recent acceleration in commodity prices as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict has exacerbated the margin pressure on packaged food companies,"" analysts from Morningstar wrote in a report on Tuesday. ""Various food and beverage companies in China have engaged in price hikes since the third quarter last year to mitigate margin compression."" Analysis: China can't do much to help Russia's sanction-hit economyChina and Russia have forged close ties in recent years, and signed a number of commodities deals during Russian President Putin's visit to Beijing last month. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine has put their friendship to the test. Beijing has not rushed to help Russia after the latter's economy was slammed by sanctions from all over the world. The complicated messaging from Beijing suggests Chinese leaders are walking ""a very difficult tightrope"" on Ukraine, analysts say."

But once she was there, she said she was turned away, with staffers explaining there was no room. They advised her to go home and quarantine.The problem? Her place of work was her home and ""my employer didn't want me to come back,"" said Maria, noting that they had ""kids in the house."" ""I said, 'I don't know where I can go. We don't have a place,'"" she told CNN Business, breaking into tears. She asked not to publish her real name, for fear of reprisals from current or future employers, and to not worry her family abroad. CNN Business agreed to call her ""Maria.""

And while some expatriates can command higher salaries for simply agreeing to move to the city, the city's poorest are struggling just to afford food or basic necessities.Heading for the exitsThe widening gap comes at a time when Hong Kong is facing an exodus of expats, despite the additional benefits on offer, which continues to raise questions about its future as a global business hub.Many foreigners have had enough of the city's unwavering commitment to its ""zero Covid"" policy, even as cases surge to record highs and cause more fatalities, overloading the health care system and delivering a huge punch to the economy. Throughout 2020 and 2021, more residents left Hong Kong than came in, according to official population statistics. That marked a reversal from early 2019, when the population was going up. Last month alone, more than 94,000 people departed the city, while only about 23,000 came in, immigration data showed.Hong Kong expats are up in arms about quarantine. Singapore stands to gain""The recent wave of emigration is leading to a shortage of skilled workers and impacting businesses of all sizes,"" the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce said in a statement earlier this month.The group's chairman, Peter Wong, said the city was ""facing an exodus of educated workers on a scale not seen since the early 1990s.""""This will have a material knock-on impact on the economy,"" he added. ""There is real cause for concern if we cannot stem the current brain drain.""The city has been largely sealed off from the rest of the world for the last two years, in part because most inbound travelers must quarantine in hotel rooms at their own expense for two weeks. Previously, the requirement was for three weeks. Hong Kong is sticking to zero-Covid, no matter what the costThe issue has increasingly forced companies to rethink where their employees should be based, if only for now. Last month, Mandarin Oriental (MAORF) CEO James Riley told the Financial Times that the former British colony had become a ""very, very poor"" base due to the restrictions.According to the newspaper, the hotel group recently advocated for senior executives to temporarily live abroad, away from its Hong Kong headquarters. Mandarin Oriental declined to comment to CNN Business.Last year, Cathay Pacific (CPCAY) said that it would consider letting some of its pilots live abroad for a few months as aircrew continued to face arduous self-isolation measures. The carrier later said that its workers spent more than 73,000 nights in government-mandated quarantine in 2021.Hong Kong kept out Covid, but exhausted and depressed pilots are paying the priceFrench spirits maker Pernod Ricard (PDRDF) has also asked top executives from its Hong Kong office to work abroad for some time, according to unidentified sources who spoke with the FT. The company did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Meanwhile, other players have moved away entirely.In November, FedEx (FDX) said it would shut down its crew base in Hong Kong and relocate pilots, citing the city's ""pandemic requirements.""From the start of the pandemic through the end of last year, at least 84 companies have either closed or moved their regional headquarters out of Hong Kong, according to CNN Business calculations based on government data. Asked about the figure, a government spokesperson responded that ""Hong Kong remains a competitive city globally and a major regional base for international companies.""The representative also pointed to emerging opportunities in the Greater Bay Area, a zone connecting Hong Kong, the southern Chinese province of Guangdong and the city of Macao as ""a market of 86 million people."" Many banks have honed in on the area as a key priority in the coming years. The government, which includes mainland Chinese companies in its annual tally of international businesses in Hong Kong, said that the number had recently ""risen to a record high of 9,049.""But the exodus amongst Western players may not slow down this year. BASF (BASFY), a German chemicals giant, recently relocated its chief for Asia Pacific, excluding Greater China, to Singapore ""after careful consideration of her office's strategic location in the region,"" according to the company.The decision was based on ""the requirement for proximity to relevant stakeholders and markets,"" it told CNN Business in a statement.More than 40% of expats in a survey are thinking of leaving Hong KongOthers may be biding their time. Hong Kong recently brought forward the end of the school year for some institutions to March or April, giving families more time to reevaluate their options before the new term begins in September.In some sectors, bonus season typically takes place around this period, too.""I suspect there's a lot of international bankers who may be waiting till then before they decide whether they've had their fill of Hong Kong,"" said a person working in the finance industry, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.Free flights and country clubsThis exodus means that top companies in the city are working extra hard to attract — and retain — skilled workers. Two senior headhunters in Hong Kong said that job candidates were increasingly pricing in the inconvenience of living in the city — if they were even persuaded to do so.""Most of them are just kind of immediately saying no,"" said John Mullally, regional director of Southern China and Hong Kong financial services at recruitment agency Robert Walters.

Most of the senior expats in Hong Kong were on a pretty juicy package that might have included flights home, and education, and club memberships and all these types of things,"" said Tibbatts. ""Over the last, let's say, 10, 15 years, most of that's been phased out.""Alibaba co-founder: Jack Ma is doing well and Hong Kong will be 'fine'Now, some of those deals are ""coming back,"" he added.Mullally also described a rising view that Hong Kong was becoming ""a bit of a hardship posting"" for expats, a term that typically refers to a place with hostile living conditions.That perception was more common from the 1970s to early 1990s, and back then justified more perks for businesspeople, he said.Now, companies are ""going to have to try to bring that back because ... realistically, if you want to attract people, that's kind of the package you'll have to put together.""Nowhere to goAs international executives jump ship, blue-collar workers and the city's poorest are being left behind to face the darkening economic outlook. It's not just in Hong Kong: Inequality around the world has worsened throughout the pandemic, with billionaires making unprecedented gains in wealth as tens of millions of people fall into poverty. Despite a growing shortage of domestic workers in Hong Kong, ""it is not easy to say whether [the pandemic] has as a whole positively or negatively impacted them,"" said Manisha Wijesinghe, executive director of HELP for Domestic Workers.""We definitely have seen a number of domestic workers who are being offered higher than statutorily mandated wages due to the shortage of incoming domestic workers,"" she said.JUST WATCHEDHear how restrictions in Hong Kong are affecting their citizensReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHear how restrictions in Hong Kong are affecting their citizens 02:51""But we have also seen domestic workers being forced to take on salaries lower than the minimum allowable wage ... there is a power imbalance."" From January 2020 to the end of 2021, the city's number of domestic workers dropped from more than 400,000 to roughly 340,000, according to government statistics. In a recent blog post, Hong Kong Labor Secretary Law Chi-kwong pointed to flight bans from certain countries as a possible reason for the slump, saying that some workers had likely been stranded abroad.When asked about the plight of domestic workers, authorities told CNN Business that foreign workers who test positive for Covid-19 ""will receive support and medical treatment like local people in Hong Kong."" And, if unemployed, they will be admitted to community isolation facilities, they said. A government spokesperson also said that it ""has continuously reminded employers of their statutory obligations and requirements"" during the pandemic, and ""any breach of such requirements will render them ineligible to employ [a domestic worker] for a period of time."" 'Zero income'While big international firms may have the privilege to up and move, most local businesses have no choice but to hunker down.As many as 50,000 small businesses could shut down over the city's fifth wave of Covid, estimates Danny Lau, chairman of the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association.That's about one in seven such registered entities across the city — and there could be more, he said.Despite soaring infections, Hong Kong officials have been holding onto the ""zero Covid"" strategy in recent weeks, introducing social distancing restrictions that have stifled local activity. Hong Kong is facing an exodus of educated workers on a scale not seen since the early 1990s.Peter Wong, chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of CommerceMany places, such as beauty parlors and fitness studios, have been forced to stop operating for months until the current measures end.""They don't have any income. Zero income,"" Lau said of those business owners. He added that some had resorted to operating secretly just to keep making a living.Like elsewhere, small businesses had already been hit hard earlier in the pandemic, especially by the lack of tourists.These firms were ""almost half dead,"" said Lau, noting that some entrepreneurs had already taken out significant loans or dug into their reserves just to stay afloat.""The worst thing is you cannot see the future,"" he added.

On Sunday, it reported 2,125 local Covid-19 cases across 58 cities, according to the National Health Commission (NHC). In Shenzhen, all businesses — apart from those deemed essential or engaged in supplying Hong Kong — have suspended operation or have implemented work-from-home policies. Public transportation, including subways and buses, have been suspended in the city, which has a population of 17.5 million.Shenzhen is also home to one of the world's largest container ports, and any disruption there could hit an already stressed out global supply chain. Last summer, the Yantian port in Shenzhen was forced to shut down for nearly a week after infections were found among dock workers, causing a massive backlog of goods that took months to clear and a spike in global freight rates. So far the port continues to operate.Shares of major companies based in Shenzhen fared poorly in Hong Kong on Monday. Tencent sank 9.8%. Telecoms firm ZTE (ZTCOF) lost 7%. BYD (BYDDF), China's largest electric car manufacturer, fell 8.3%.

But another economic indicator is starting to look ominous: The yield curve is flattening.,"economy, US economy flashes a recession warning sign - CNN",US economy flashes a recession warning sign,"New York (CNN Business)Surging oil and gas prices have raised recession alarm bells around the world. But another economic indicator is starting to look ominous: The yield curve is flattening.Wall Street closely watches the difference, or spread, between short-term government bond yields, most notably the 2-year Treasury, and longer-term bond rates like the 10-year Treasury. As that spread diminishes, investors worry that the yield curve could eventually invert, meaning that short-term rates would be higher than long-term yields. As of Friday, the difference was just 0.25%, with the 10-year yield at around 2% and the 2-year yielding 1.75%. The gap widened a bit Monday, as the 10-year rose to 2.1% and the 2-year yield was up to about 1.82%, making the spread 0.28%.Inverted yield curve often occurs before recessionsRead MoreAn inverted yield curve has often been a potential recession signal. The yield curve inverted in 2019 before the 2020 Covid-induced recession. It also did so in 2007 before the 2008 Global Financial Crisis/Great Recession. And it inverted in early 2000 right before the dot-com/tech stock meltdown.US Labor Secretary Marty Walsh told CNN's Poppy Harlow that a recession is ""a real likelihood"" but he added that ""we have a very strong economy"" and noted that the job market in particular is healthy.When investors want higher rates for short-term bonds, it's an indication that bondholders are nervous. Typically, rates for long-term bonds are higher because you have to wait longer to get paid back. So how worried should investors be that the yield curve might invert?Some argue that the only reason this is happening is because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the resulting spike in commodity prices. ""The risks of a recession are building but not necessarily immediate unless the global geopolitics dramatically deteriorate from this delicate starting point,"" Jim Reid, a strategist with Deutsche Bank, said in a report.The Fed's job just got even harderThe Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to raise interest rates later this week, may be careful to not raise rates so aggressively that short-term yields increase even further and wind up flipping the yield curve. That could cause a slowdown in the job market. And the Fed is supposed to keep an eye on unemployment rates as well as inflation.""Chair [Jerome] Powell will make it clear that the Fed is aware of its dual mandate and does not want to invert the yield curve and produce a recession,"" Jay Hatfield, chief investment officer at ICAP, said in a report.  Inflation concerns existed before Russia-UkraineAlthough geopolitical tension could be distorting prices, inflation pressures were already building before the Russian attack on Ukraine.""Russia/Ukraine is only pulling forward the natural slowing in the economy that would have occurred as the Fed tightened policy,"" said Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, in a note last week. Essaye argues that Fed rate hikes and a slowing economy would have likely led to an inverted yield curve at some point later this year even if Russia and Ukraine weren't in the headlines.""The looming rate hikes (which are still coming) will combine with the growth slowing impulse of higher commodity prices and higher inflation to bring a sooner than previously expected slowing of growth,"" he said.Rising short-term rates could also create problems for large Wall Street firms. Although higher rates tend to boost profits for loans, they also make trading, particularly for bonds, more of a gamble.

Rates fall when investors are buying bonds. So traders are clearly still finding US Treasury debt to be stable enough to keep flocking to it. But it is unusual to see short-term rates fall this sharply.One strategist noted that it doesn't matter if investors are buying bonds because they perceive them to be safe. There is still a lot to worry about. ""The recession drumbeat is gaining in volume,"" Nancy Tengler, CEO and CIO of Laffer Tengler Investments, said in a report. ""Of course there are many reasons to be concerned. Soaring inflation, rising energy costs, an almost sure recession in the Euro Zone and a dangerously flat yield curve."" ""Never mind that the yield curve is being distorted by a massive flight to quality,"" Tengler added. ""An inversion is an inversion."""

But Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia threw a wrench into those plans Monday.The crux of the matter is the nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former deputy Treasury secretary and a governor of the Federal Reserve Board during the Obama administration, who is facing opposition in a divided Senate.Raskin's stance on environmental issues, including her view on the transition away from fossil fuels, are colliding with soaring gas prices and a renewed debate about oil independence in the face of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.""Her previous public statements have failed to satisfactorily address my concerns about the critical importance of financing an all-of-the-above energy policy to meet our nation's critical energy needs,"" Manchin said in a statement on Monday announcing his opposition to Raskin's nomination. Manchin is not a member of the Senate Banking Committee that will be voting on Raskin's candidacy.The US Chamber of Commerce already voiced concern over her nomination to be the vice chair of supervision -- essentially the Fed's top banking regulator -- in January. And a month ago, Senate Republicans boycotted a vote in protest of Raskin's nomination, halting a slate of pending nominees for the central bank.Read MoreThe renomination of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for another term is also stalled. Even though Powell is enjoying support on both sides of the aisle, he hasn't been fully confirmed yet, leaving him with the title add-on ""pro tempore"" for now.All this comes at a time when Fed policy has taken center stage amid rampant inflation. Consumer prices haven't risen at this fast a pace since 1982.The central bank is expected to raise interest rates by a quarter-percentage point this week in an effort to curb demand and bring prices under control.Meanwhile, the White House continued to stand behind Raskin's nomination. Biden has pledged to make the Fed more diverse in terms of both its gender and racial make up. The president also nominated Philip Jefferson and Lisa Cook to join the central bank. Cook would be the first Black woman to serve at the Fed in its history.""Sarah Bloom Raskin is one of the most qualified people to have ever been nominated for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors -- she previously served on the Board and she served as second-in-command at Treasury, both positions where she earned bipartisan Senate confirmation,"" a White House official said.The administration was working to line up bipartisan support for her confirmation, the official added, calling the adversity surrounding her nomination an ""unprecedented, baseless campaign led by oil and gas companies.""CNN's Manu Raju and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report."

They say that the board has failed to adopt and implement a climate strategy that aligns with the 2015 Paris Agreement, claiming that amounts to an alleged breach of the directors' duties under the UK Companies Act.ClientEarth said it had written to Shell notifying it of its claim and was waiting for it to respond before filing papers at the High Court of England and Wales. For the case to proceed, ClientEarth would then need permission from the court to do so.""We believe that there are sufficient grounds to assert that Shell's board is mismanaging the material and foreseeable climate risk facing the company,"" said ClientEarth lawyer Paul Benson in a statement. ""Unless the board changes course, long-term value will be eroded, and eventually destroyed,"" he added.In a written response to Reuters, Shell said it was delivering on its global strategy that supported the Paris Agreement on climate, including by ""transforming our business to provide more low-carbon energy for customers.""Read More""Addressing a challenge as big as climate change requires action from all quarters.

Shell is appealing that ruling.ClientEarth, a not-for-profit, has a track record of winning climate litigation cases. Last year it won a case against the European Investment Bank, in which the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled it had illegally avoided environmental scrutiny of its financing decisions. In 2020, the company Enea suspended construction of a coal plant in Poland after the group took it to court. The court ruled that authorizing the project was legally invalid. Energy companies are facing a challenge to their business model as countries look to cut use of fossil fuels, a major cause of human-made global warming, and reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century.Shell has pledged to halve the greenhouse gas emissions from its operations by 2030, but its plans to reduce emissions from the actual use of its products was not far-reaching enough, ClientEarth said. Shell's net-zero target was also not reflected in the company's operating plans or budgets, ClientEarth added.UN climate scientists have reiterated the need for faster global action and said failure to hit the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial norms would cause irreparable damage. The UK Companies Act would require Shell to act in a way that promotes the company's success, and to do so whilst exercising reasonable care, skill and diligence.ClientEarth said it was bringing the action as a shareholder in Shell on behalf of all stakeholders to help protect the long-term viability of the company."

Six arms protrude from the top, hoisting giant blocks into the sky. But these aren't building blocks, and the crane isn't being used for construction. The steel tower is a giant mechanical energy storage system, designed by American-Swiss startup Energy Vault, that relies on gravity and 35-ton bricks to store and release energy. When power demand is low, the crane uses surplus electricity from the Swiss grid to raise the bricks and stack them at the top. When power demand rises, the bricks are lowered, releasing kinetic energy back to the grid. It might sound like a school science project, but this form of energy storage could be vital as the world transitions to clean energy.35-ton blocks, made of recycled or locally sourced materials, are raised to the top of the crane where they store energy.""There's a big push to get renewables deployed,"" Robert Piconi, founder of Energy Vault, tells CNN Business, adding that companies are under increasing pressure from governments, investors and employees to decarbonize.Read MoreBut relying on renewables for consistent power is impossible without energy storage, he says. Unlike a fossil fuel power station, which can operate night and day, wind and solar power are intermittent, meaning that if a cloud blocks the sun or there's a lull in the wind, electricity generation drops.To compete with fossil fuels, you need to ""make renewables predictable,"" says Piconi, which means storing excess energy and being able to dispatch it when required. Battery alternativesOne solution to this problem is lithium-ion batteries, which are already linked up to power grids worldwide. They can be charged using electricity generated from wind and solar and release that energy on demand. The technology has advanced rapidly in recent decades, says Dan Shreve, global head of energy storage at Wood Mackenzie, an energy research and consultancy firm. For the most part, they have been used for short-term energy storage (up to six hours), he says, and as decarbonization ramps up, demand for more durable storage will rise.Another drawback is that lithium is a limited resource, found only in certain parts of the world, and mining it can harm the environment. While the cost of batteries has plummeted over the last decade, prices started to soar in 2021 as lithium demand outstripped supply. For these reasons, Piconi says that while batteries are great for electric cars or computer electronics, they're not ""ideal for large utility-scale trade."" 













Instead, Energy Vault decided to base its technology on a method developed over 100 years ago, which is widely used to store renewable energy: pumped storage hydropower. During off-peak periods, a turbine pumps water from a reservoir on low ground to one on higher ground, and during periods of peak demand, the water is allowed to flow down through the turbine, generating electrical energy. Piconi says Energy Vault relies on gravity in the same way, but ""instead of using water, we're using these composite blocks."" By doing it this way, he says the company is not dependent on topography and doesn't have to dig out reservoirs or create dams, which can have negative effects on the environment. ""Simple and elegant""Since Energy Vault established its successful prototype in Switzerland in 2020, the company has pivoted from the tower model design, which could reach up to 200 meters in height, to 20-story modular buildings it calls ""Energy Vault Resiliency Centers."" Piconi says the company received feedback from potential clients that the tower was ""too tall"" and might not comply with international building codes.Energy Vault pivoted its design from giant cranes to vast energy storage buildings, as shown in this rendering.The resiliency centers will use the same bricks, made from soil and waste products, and the buildings will be around 100 meters tall. Bricks will move up and down inside the building on trolleys, controlled by an artificial intelligence system that identifies optimal times for charging or discharging energy, depending on supply and demand.The centers will vary in footprint, possibly covering between 1.5 and 20 acres depending on the storage capacity, he adds. But they are likely to be installed in places where space isn't an issue, such as near existing wind or solar plants. Energy Vault's technology is ""simple and elegant,"" says Shreve, but he questions whether the devices can compete with lithium-ion batteries on price. Even so, the market is hungry for battery alternatives. While other startups — such as UK-based Gravitricity, which drops weights down disused mineshafts — are also exploring gravity-based energy storage, none yet match the scale of Energy Vault.In February, Energy Vault listed on the New York stock exchange, raising approximately $235 million. It recently announced that actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio had joined the company's strategic advisory board. Energy Vault's resiliency centers will be linked up to nearby wind or solar farms, as shown in this rendering. Credit: Energy Vault
This year, Energy Vault will start building resiliency centers for DG fuels, which wants a continuous supply of renewable energy to create green hydrogen fuel for the aviation industry. It has also signed deals worth up to $880 million with companies including Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil producer, metal smelting company Korea Zinc, and mining giant BHP. With this backing, Piconi is confident Energy Vault can help to accelerate the energy transition.So far, customers have signed up to projects that equate to 2.5 gigawatt hours of energy storage — a significant addition to the 17 gigawatt hours of battery storage that Wood Mackenzie estimates is currently in operation in the United States. ""In terms of impact, that's pretty massive,"" says Piconi."

But the computer chip shortage is proving that adage wrong.Ford (F) will begin shipping Explorer SUVs without all of its chips to address the tight inventory of vehicles available for sale at dealerships.The automaker disclosed this weekend that it would build Explorers without rear-seat controls for the air conditioner and heat. The driver and front-seat passenger will still be able to adjust climate controls for backseat passengers — but people in the back won't be able to change the temperature themselves.""We're doing this as a way to get our customers their vehicles sooner,"" said Ford spokesperson Said Deep. He said Ford had already offered buyers of its best-selling F-150 pickup a choice: They could give up a fuel-saving feature called ""start-stop"" and get a $50 credit — or they could wait for the truck to be built with the feature. Start-stop automatically turns the engine off when the truck comes to a complete stop, and restarts it when the driver takes his or her foot off the brake.Read MoreThe start-stop option is only available at the time an F-150 is built, and cannot be added after the fact. But Deep said Ford will be able to install the rear-seat climate control feature on Explorers shipped without the feature once the chips become available. It will be added at dealerships at no cost to the owners.Virtually all automakers have been forced to temporarily shut production at some of their factories over the last year and a half due to the lack of computer chips and, in some cases, other parts. The reduced inventories of new vehicles for sale have lifted car prices to record levels — a major factor in America's highest rate of inflation in nearly 40 years.Why car prices remain so stubbornly highFord is not the only automaker shipping vehicles without all the features they were designed to include. Last year General Motors was forced to temporarily stop offering several features, including a fuel management module designed to improve mileage in the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups by about one mile per gallon. GM also stopped offering a stop-start feature on some of its heavy-duty pickups.GM also had to exclude some comfort features, such as heated and cooled seats in a variety of models, the adjustable lumbar support in the Cadillac XT4, as well as parking assist features. But GM (GM) also expects it will be able to offer a free retrofit for those features once the chips become available."

Now he says he would settle for continuing to feel safe using its cruise control. Morris is one of hundreds of Tesla owners claiming that the automaker's cruise control has deteriorated and turned dangerous in the last year on some models. They've filed complaints with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which opened an investigation last month.  In the complaints, the owners say they've nearly been rear-ended after their vehicles brake unexpectedly, which they call ""phantom braking."" Many say they have stopped using cruise control because they're afraid it will trigger a crash. Some drivers have said on social media and in interviews with CNN Business that the cruise control issues have them questioning when or if Tesla will deliver self-driving vehicles, which tech and auto companies have promised for years.   Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 that self-driving Teslas were probably either a year or two away. More recently, he's said that self-driving will be a reality this year, even as the automaker continues to describe its more basic driver-assist feature ""traffic-aware cruise control,"" as a beta feature almost seven years after its launch. (Beta is Silicon Valley lingo for an unfinished and imperfect product.) ""They're burning up a lot of good will with not being transparent,"" Morris told CNN Business. ""People are starting to realize, 'My car may actually never drive itself.'"" Read MoreTesla did not respond to a request for comment.""The ultimate gadget"" Morris, a software engineer in Indiana, describes Teslas as ""the ultimate gadget."" He grew excited in recent years after hearing Musk's talk of Teslas driving themselves. ""I wanted to make sure I got a Tesla with all the bells and whistles, and 'full self-driving' was one of them,"" Morris said, referring to a Tesla driver-assist feature that is expected to eventually be able to drive the vehicle. For now, ""full self-driving"" requires an attentive driver behind the wheel, and has only been released to a limited number of Tesla drivers, who have described significant issues. Morris said he was happy with his first Tesla, a 2016 Model S. When its warranty ended, he purchased the Model X he still owns today. Then almost a year ago, Morris surprised his wife on Mother's Day with a Tesla Model Y. Morris said shortly before the SUV arrived, Tesla messaged him to say that the radar was being phased out of the automaker's cruise control. Most automakers rely on radar for adaptive cruise control, which speeds up and slows down the vehicle slightly to keep pace with a vehicle in front of it. (Tesla calls its adaptive cruise control, ""traffic-aware cruise control."") Most autonomous vehicle experts favor sensor fusion, in which camera and radar data are combined to sense a car's surroundings.  ""It's like pairing one A student with another A student,"" said Steven Hong, vice president of radar technology at Ambarella, which is combining radar and camera in a driver-assist system. ""Put them together and you'll get an A+ on your perception project as they cover each other's weaknesses."" Cameras can struggle in poor lighting conditions whereas radar functions even if there is rain, fog, or mud covering the vehicle, he said. Trouble for Morris began not long after the Model Y arrived, he said. The car often braked unexpectedly as his wife commuted on a two-lane road in rural Indiana. According to a review by CNN Business, more than 120 drivers have filed complaints with NHTSA describing unexpected braking on two-lane roads. ""Cruise control is completely unusable on two-lane roads,"" wrote one person in February who said they were from Des Moines, Iowa. As his wife drove on the two-lane road last fall, her Model Y slammed on its brakes so hard that his children's empty booster seats in the second row flew forward and crashed into the front seats, he said.  A concerned Morris reached out to Tesla. The automaker told Morris, according to screenshots shared with CNN Business, that there was no hardware failure. ""Because there is no need for service we will close out this appointment,"" the automaker wrote. It also explained that cruise control is a beta feature. ""As far as I understand cruise control should not be a beta feature,"" he replied. Then he checked his owner's manual, which calls traffic-aware cruise control a beta feature. Tesla introduced the feature in 2015 and based on a review of Tesla owner's manuals, it appears that the automaker started labeling it a ""beta"" feature in 2018. Morris filed a complaint with the US government in November, noting that ""we don't accept beta seatbelts or beta tires."" Thirty other Tesla owners filing complaints of unexpected braking say that Tesla has either canceled service appointments or told them there is nothing they can do, according to a CNN Business review of complaints. Cruising along Tesla introduced ""traffic-aware cruise control"" to its vehicles in 2015. Previously, Teslas included a basic cruise control that held a consistent speed without requiring that drivers keep their foot on the accelerator, according to a review of Tesla owners' manuals. Traffic-aware cruise control initially relied on a radar and camera to sense the road ahead, and Tesla warned of the feature's limitations. ""Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may occasionally brake Model S when not required,"" cautioned the 2015 Model S owner's manual. A similar warning remains in the latest Tesla owners' manuals. Other automakers also warned that adaptive cruise control has shortcomings. Ford, for example, cautions that its system may brake unexpectedly. It recommends against using adaptive cruise control on winding roads, as do General Motors, Toyota, Honda and Tesla, according to a review of owner's manuals.Morris, the Tesla owner, also drives a Ford F-150 with adaptive cruise control. He said he's never experienced unexpected braking with it. He said his Model X, which has a radar, does not brake unexpectedly on the same roads that his wife's radar-less Tesla struggled with. But the use of radar does not prevent all unexpected braking issues. NHTSA opened an investigation last month into unexpected braking of 2017-2019 Honda CR-Vs and 2018-19 Honda Accords following 278 complaints. Honda's system relies on radar. Tesla owners have long described on social media episodes of phantom braking on radar-equipped vehicles, generally slowing the car about 5 mph, not as severe as what's been reported to NHTSA.  Morris has since traded in the Model Y for Ford's Mustang Mach-E. The infotainment system is ""kind of clunky"" and can't match Tesla's, he said, but his unexpected braking worries are gone. The F-150 and Mustang's system relies on a radar and camera. Morris said he would have kept the Model Y if it had offered a dumbed-down cruise control that held a constant speed. He still loves his Model X, for now. ""If they ever disable my radar,"" Morris said. ""I'm going to probably get rid of it, too."""

The space agency sought to reaffirm Monday that it's still working closely with Russian space agency Rocosmos on the International Space Station, despite mounting geopolitical tensions.Vande Hei, who launched to the ISS in April 2021, is slated to make his return trip on March 30. He'll land aboard the Russian Soyuz spacecraft in Kazakhstan, as is customary. NASA officials did not say there would be any significant changes to plans to get Vande Hei back to the United States after he lands. He'll travel home via a Gulfstream jet, as other US astronauts have before him.For nearly a decade, Russia's Soyuz vehicles had been the only means of getting astronauts to and from the space station. But that reliance ended after SpaceX debuted its Crew Dragon capsule in 2020, and the US regained human spaceflight capabilitiesThe US still has previously purchased seats on Russian vehicles for NASA astronauts, however, and there are tentative agreements for US astronauts to ride on Russian Soyuz vehicles and for Russian cosmonauts to fly with SpaceX in the future.Joint operations between NASA and Roscosmos at the Russian facilities at Baikonur, Kazakhstan ""continue to go well,"" Joel Montalbano, the manager of NASA's International Space Station program, said, ""I can tell you for sure Mark [Vande Hei] is coming home"" on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft.Read MoreMontalbano's remarks come as Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin made several fiery social media posts directed at the United States, including a heavily edited, partially animated video that appeared to threaten that Russian astronauts would abandon Vande Hei in space. Rogozin has long been known to share outlandish statements on social media.Former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly and Russian space chief engage in Twitter fight Amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions from the United States and its allies, Rogozin has also grounded the launch of telecom satellites from UK-based startup OneWeb. He's also pledged to no longer sell Russian-made rocket engines to US companies.Despite mounting tensions, NASA has attempted to convey that, behind the scenes, the US and Russia continue to work together on ISS operations. Earlier Monday, Russian state new outlet Tass announced Vande Hei would return on the Russian spacecraft as planned.And that work is crucial to keep the station going. Montalbano said the ""space station was designed to be interdependent.""""Each of the partners have different capabilities that they bring, and together we work,"" he said. ""It's not a process where one group can separate from the other. We need everything together in order to be successful.""When CNN's Kristin Fisher asked whether NASA has contingency plans in place in case the Roscosmos-NASA relationship does deteriorate, Montalbano said, ""the International Space Station, I'll tell you, it's been the flagship model for international cooperation.""""At this time there's no indication from our Russian partners that they want to do anything different,"" he said. ""So, we are planning to continue operations as, as we are today.""Russian space chief says Russia will no longer sell rocket engines to the USNASA's Montalbano said Monday that they are continuing to work on those negotiations and plan to move forward with a crew swap agreement."

The announcement comes after CNN confirmed earlier that Davidson was in talks with the company for a seat aboard its supersonic rocket, which launches vertically from a rural Texas launch pad on Bezos' ranch.After years of quiet development, Blue Origin's space tourism rocket made its crewed launch debut last year with Bezos, flying alongside a heroine of the space community, Wally Funk, his brother Mark Bezos and a paying customer. Since then, Blue Origin has been making headlines for flying other well-known names on two subsequent flights, including Star Trek star William Shatner and Good Morning America host Michael Strahan. Read MoreBlue Origin's goal is to make these suborbital spaceflights a mainstay of pop culture, giving a 10-minute supersonic joy ride to welcomed guests — which thus far have mostly been celebrities — and anyone else who can afford it.Davidson will be joined on his flight by five paying customers. They include Marty Allen, an investor and the former CEO of a party supply store; Jim Kitchen, an entrepreneur and business professor; George Nield, a former associate administrator for the Federal Aviation Administration Office of Commercial Space Transportation; Marc Hagle, an Orlando real estate developer and his wife, Sharon Hagle, who founded a space-focused nonprofit.A billionaire CEO is on track to go further into space than any human in 50 yearsThe crew will spend a few days training at Blue Origin's facilities in West Texas before the flight day, when they'll climb into the New Shepard crew capsule that sits atop the rocket. After liftoff, the rocket will tear past the speed of sound, and near the top of its flight path, will detach from the capsule. As the rocket booster heads back toward the Earth for an upright landing, the crewed capsule will continue soaring higher into the atmosphere to more than 60 miles above the surface where the blackness of space is visible and the capsule's windows will offer sweeping views of the Earth.As the flight reaches its apex, the passengers will experience a few minutes of weightlessness. Bezos notably spent his time in weightlessness throwing Skittles and flipping around in the cabin. Others have been glued to the window.As gravity begins to pull the capsule back toward the ground, the passengers will again experience intense g-forces before sets of parachutes are deployed to slow the vehicle down. It will then touch down at less than 20 miles per hour in the Texas desert.Blue Origin's New Shepard lifts off from the launch pad carrying 90-year-old Star Trek actor William Shatner and three other civilians on October 13, 2021 near Van Horn, Texas. Because the flights are suborbital — meaning the don't generate enough speed or take the right trajectory to avoid being immediately dragged back down by Earth's gravity — the whole show will last only about 10 minutes.Blue Origin is the first company to begin offering regular suborbital space tourism flights. Its chief competitor, Virgin Galactic, notably had its first crewed flight — which included founder Richard Branson — before Bezos' flight last July. But Virgin Galactic has yet to follow up that flight with another crewed flight after it later became clear that the company's space plane had traveled out of its designated flight path. The company now says its undergoing unrelated technology upgrades and may return to flight later this year.SpaceX is the only private company that offers trips to orbit. The company completed the first-ever all-civilian flight to orbit last September, taking a billionaire and three chosen crewmates on a three-day trip. And later this month, the company plans to take four paying customers on a flight to the International Space Station, which orbits about 200 miles above Earth.Blue Origin does have plans to build a rocket powerful enough to reach orbit, called New Glenn. And, in light of the news that Russia may no longer sell rocket engines to the United States, those plans are more pressing than ever. The engines Blue Origin plans to use for New Glenn, the BE-4, will also be used on an upcoming launch vehicle designed by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing that is responsible for significant US national security launches. ULA currently relies on Russian RD-180 engines.Blue Origin did not have specific updates on BE-4 when reached for comment.CNN's Rachel Crane contributed"

India's young investors prefer bitcoin to gold and 'boring' stocks,"New Delhi (CNN Business)Indian businesswoman Swati Daga first bought bitcoin in 2017, when the cryptocurrency was trading well under $3,000. Her decision to invest in digital currencies was met with wariness by her family, she recalls. ""The elders in my family told me not to throw my money away,"" said Daga, who runs a food business near New Delhi.But the 33-year-old hasn't regretted her decision — bitcoin's value has increased 15 times since then — and she continues to invest as much as 10% of her savings in cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ethereum. ""I find stock markets boring,"" she told CNN Business, adding that she enjoys the ""thrill"" and ""recklessness"" that comes with investing in volatile currencies.  She is not the only one.  Read MoreIndia has seen a huge boom in cryptocurrency trading since the start of the pandemic, even though authorities in Asia's third largest economy have for years expressed concerns about digital currencies, and even flirted with banning them. Entrepreneurs in the industry told CNN Business that the country has the potential to become a crypto superpower, since it is one of the hottest internet markets in the world, with 750 million users, and hundreds of millions more yet to come online for the first time. India ranked second behind only Vietnam last year in a list of countries seeing the fastest growth in cryptocurrency adoption, according to a report published in October by blockchain data platform Chainalysis.While the government does not keep estimates of how many people trade cryptocurrencies, industry experts have suggested that the country may now have more than 20 million crypto investors. The growth is driven by younger investors — mostly under the age of 35 — and many of them are coming from smaller cities and towns, founders of two of India's biggest crypto exchanges told CNN Business. According to Sumit Gupta, CEO and co-founder of exchange CoinDCX, many Indian millennials have started ""their investing journey with crypto.""While 20 years ago, their parents chose to invest in gold, these youngsters ""are more interested in having bitcoin as part of their portfolio,"" Gupta told CNN Business, referring to the fact that traditionally Indians chose to park their money in gold or savings accounts. Buying gold is both an investment and a cultural habit in India, which is one of the largest markets for the precious metal, according to the World Gold Council. It also considered auspicious by Hindus and Jains, and plays a fundamental role in many religious ceremonies.Mumbai-based CoinDCX became India's first crypto unicorn last year, achieving a valuation of $1.1 billion after raising money from investors such as Coinbase Ventures and B Capital Group. The company says 70% of its 10 million users are between the age of 18 and 34. The CoinDCX app is seen on a phone screen in West Bengal, India, in August 2021.Data shared by rival firm WazirX tell a similar story. WazirX also has over 10 million users, and called 2021 a ""phenomenal year"" for crypto trading in India. The company was acquired by Binance, one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, in 2019.Over 65% of its users are under the age of 35, according to a recent company report, and it has seen a ""700% increase in the number of participants from smaller cities like Guwahati, Karnal, Bareilly, thereby signaling the growing interest from rural and semi-urban areas."" Pritish Kumawat, a crypto trader from a small town in the western state of Rajasthan, said that he now finds conversations about cryptocurrencies in almost every tea shop in his area. Often, the most engaged participants are college students, he said, adding that bitcoin's massive spike last year has fueled the frenzy in India. In November, bitcoin was trading at a record high of $68,990, but it has since fallen to around $43,000. In addition to bitcoin, meme currencies such as dogecoin and shiba inu are also popular among Indians, the WazirX report added. Apart from investors from smaller towns, both companies saw an increase of more than 1000% in the number of women users on their platforms, albeit on a small base.Gupta said that participation of crypto by Indian women has seen ""a massive upside"" in the past 18 months and is ""fairly high, fairly healthy, relative to equity markets."" The company's data shows that 15% of their overall users are women — which is the global trend as well.On-again, off-again relationshipThe excitement over crypto is rising in India despite the country's on-again, off-again relationship with digital currencies. The central bank has long expressed concerns that cryptocurrencies can be used for money laundering and to finance terrorism. A cryptically worded proposal posted on the Indian parliament website last year even suggested the government was exploring plans to ""prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India.""This year, however, started on a more cheerful note for enthusiasts. Earlier this month, the Indian government announced it would impose a 30% tax on income from virtual digital assets, which many industry experts took as a sign that crypto trading won't be banned after all. The government also said it would launch a digital rupee in the coming months. ""Taxation of virtual digital assets or crypto is a step in the right direction. It gives much-needed clarity and confidence to the industry,"" Gupta said at the time of the announcement.Siddharth Menon, the co-founder of WazirX, told CNN Business that following the announcement, his platform saw daily sign-ups jump by over 50%. He also noticed rising interest among Indian developers and other professionals in joining the crypto industry. WazirX's website is shown in New York, USA, in April 2021.""I'm getting LinkedIn messages"" from senior executives in India, who are now more optimistic about the business, he said. In the past, Indian exchanges have struggled to hire and retain experienced people due to the lack of clear regulations. But the Indian government soon put a damper on the mood, by clarifying that the cryptocurrencies are not yet legal in the country.""I am not doing anything to legalize it or ban it or not legalize it,"" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in parliament a few days after announcing the tax rate. ""Banning or not banning will come subsequently ... But I will tax because it is a sovereign right."" ""I think the government is not entirely sure what it wants to do from a policy perspective,"" said Anirudh Rastogi, founder of tech law firm Ikigaw Law, which works with crypto exchanges in India.""It knows where it wants to land broadly. It wants to find the right balance where it is not disconnected from the global progress in blockchain and other tech, but it wants to also address concerns regarding cryptocurrency.""Rastogi added that the ""extraordinarily high"" tax on crypto is a short-term fix, which will also acts as a deterrent to many investors. ""This rate is typically used to tax activities that are not considered economically productive, such as lottery,"" he said. ""So this could be an indication that the government wants to make revenue, but it does not see crypto trading as economically productive.""For equities, India applies a 15% short-term capital gains tax if shares are sold in less than a year, and 10% if sold after a year.Gupta hopes that the government makes up its mind soon. India, with its vast pool of developers and enthusiastic young population, could be a ""superpower in the next five to 10 years,"" in cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, he said. ""What is missing right now is a clear regulatory framework,"" he added."

Ending the pandemic proved much harder - CNN",India's billionaire vaccine prince held the key to ending the pandemic. His plans went awry,"As Covid-19 wreaked havoc around the world last year, the 39-year-old son of an Indian billionaire was laying the groundwork for a plan he hoped would eventually end the pandemic.Adar Poonawalla — the CEO of Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker — pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into his Indian manufacturing facility and committed to make millions of doses of a then-unproven coronavirus vaccine. That vaccine, created by Oxford University and AstraZeneca (AZN), was still in clinical trials at the time. Nobody was sure how long a vaccine would take to develop, let alone whether it would even work. ""It was a calculated risk,"" Poonawalla told CNN Business. ""But I didn't see the choice at that time, to be honest. I just felt I'd regret not committing one way or another.""Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute of India, chose to commit to making a vaccine while it was still in clinical trials.To make his plan work, Poonawalla first had to raise nearly $1 billion. And the lives of hundreds of millions of the planet's most vulnerable people were at stake, since SII had pledged to provide poorer countries with jabs. If the gamble paid off, Poonawalla would save countless lives and be hailed as a hero during a period of historic turmoil. His fabulously rich family also would stand to grow even more wealthy by profiting from a significant deal. Read MoreAs the world gave its money — and trust — to Poonawalla, things seemed to be going according to plan. The AstraZeneca vaccine received approval from UK regulators in December 2020, and Poonawalla became a household name in India. ""It was a calculated risk. But I didn't see the choice at that time, to be honest. I just felt I'd regret not committing one way or another.""SII CEO Adar Poonawalla, on committing his company to make millions of doses of a then-unproven Covid vaccineBut soon it became evident how badly Poonawalla had miscalculated the challenges that come with distributing millions of vaccines in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic. His company's ability to inoculate even his own countrymen was thrown into doubt earlier this year as a devastating wave of coronavirus hit India. He's also failed to keep up with his commitment to deliver shots to other nations — the consequences of which have dented his reputation and shed light on the perils of such heavy reliance on one manufacturer. From horse breeders to vaccine makersIt's easy to see why some of the biggest names in public health chose to rely on Poonawalla. Few manufacturers can come close to the scale at which SII is able to produce vaccines. The company — which was founded by Poonawalla's father, Cyrus, 55 years ago — produces 1.5 billion vaccines each year for measles, rubella, tetanus and many other diseases. The jabs are mainly distributed to low-income countries worldwide, including India. Poonawalla estimates that just over 50% of the world's babies depend on vaccines made at SII. The Poonawalla family charted an unusual path to becoming one of the world's preeminent vaccine makers. They have bred and raced thoroughbred horses since the 1940s, diversifying into pharmaceuticals, finance and real estate over the last half-century.Cyrus Poonawalla is now India's seventh-richest man, worth more than $16 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. His son Adar took over as CEO in 2011 and has focused on expanding in international markets. To prepare for the AstraZeneca vaccine production, Poonawalla said he spent $800 million on buying chemicals, glass vials and other raw materials, as well as ramping up manufacturing capacity at his plant in the Western Indian city of Pune. More than $250 million came from the company's own funds. Another $300 million came from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which SII collaborated with to provide discounted or free doses to low-income countries. The rest was paid by other countries once SII started accepting orders for vaccines. In total, SII agreed to make up to 200 million vaccine doses for as many as 92 countries, as part of its deal with the Gates Foundation and Gavi, a vaccine alliance.All of that happened, though, before regulators signed off on the AstraZeneca vaccine. Had trials for that vaccine been unsuccessful, SII would ""just be making batches and then end up throwing them away,"" Poonawalla said.Poonawalla said he spent $800 million on materials including chemicals and glass vials to prepare for vaccine production.A business studies graduate of London's University of Westminster, Poonawalla said SII was able to make that decision more swiftly than many other companies, since it is a family-run business. ""The flexibility of being able to decide on the spot very quickly was really the main game-changer that enabled us to be able to do this,"" said Poonawalla, whose office in India is a refurbished Airbus A320. After UK regulators approved the vaccine, Poonawalla began supplying doses to Indians and other other countries. By May, Gavi had received some 30 million jabs from SII. India's Covid-19 tsunamiBut Poonawalla's plans soon went awry when a second wave of Covid-19 hit India in the spring. At its peak the country was reporting over 400,000 cases per day, though experts say the actual number was likely much higher. At that point, only 2% percent of India's 1.3 billion population was fully vaccinated, and the country's national government had been slow in placing orders for more vaccines. Without a massive stockpile, states in India began to run out of the limited number of jabs they had.India then decided to stop the export of all vaccines, preventing SII from keeping up with its commitments elsewhere.A brutal second wave of Covid-19 hit India in spring 2021.""I've always been a patriot for my country ... and if my country needs my facility first, I have to do what they say,"" Poonawalla said. ""There was no two ways about that.""The inability to export vaccines hurt some of the poorest nations in the world. The director of Africa's disease control body, for example, warned India's hold on exports could be ""catastrophic"" for the continent. People in several countries, from neighboring Nepal to Kenya, were left stranded after receiving the first dose of Covishield, the name of the India-manufactured vaccine.When asked why the global vaccine alliance chose to rely so heavily on one manufacturer, a Gavi spokesperson told CNN Business it had few options. At the start of 2021, ""very few vaccines were approved and available for deployment,"" the spokesperson said, adding that it was ""natural"" that SII would be contracted for early doses given its size. But public health expert Jeffrey Lazarus said there were flaws in the plan. ""Relying on one manufacturer was a mistake, which is easier to see in hindsight,"" said Lazarus, who heads the health systems research group at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health.Being held to accountWhile Poonawalla cannot be held responsible for some of the issues that led to the vaccine rollout stalling — chief among them, India's massive outbreak — his detractors have questioned parts of his approach. They point out Poonawalla hasn't delivered the number of jabs he initially promised, and they claim he hasn't been transparent about how he's been using all of the money he raised for the big vaccine push.""There isn't much accountability for where the money he raised went,"" Malini Aisola, co-convenor of health sector watchdog All India Drug Action Network, told CNN Business. In June last year, SII pledged it would make one billion doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine for low and middle income countries, with 400 million doses ready by the end of 2020. But by January 2021, the company had a stockpile of just 70 million doses. His critics weren't impressed, given the amount of capital he raised last year. SII declined to comment on the amount it has made from its vaccine production so far. Poonawalla called it ""very unreasonable and naive"" for people to expect companies not to profit from these efforts.The global media coverage also turned unfavorable, with headlines linking the global shortfall in vaccines to SII's problems, including the India export ban and a fire at the company's Pune facility. At the time Poonawalla said the fire had no effect on Covishield production. But he has since reversed course, saying that the incident has played a major role in hampering manufacturing.He also insists he was realistic about his goals. ""We always underpromise,"" Poonawalla told CNN Business, when asked whether the company pledged more than it could deliver. Still, he's been dogged by other controversies that have dented his reputation. As India's Covid-19 cases were skyrocketing in April, Poonawalla lowered the price of his vaccine and referred to the move as a ""philanthropic gesture"" — leading to heavy criticism, with activists pointing out that even a small profit is still a profit for SII.""AstraZeneca has pledged that it won't make profits from low income and middle income countries during the pandemic, but that does not seem to apply to SII,"" Aisola said. According to AstraZeneca, the companies the drugmaker has sublicensing agreements with, including SII, dictate their own prices. SII declined to comment on how much it has profited from the vaccine efforts so far, but Poonawalla said it is a ""very unreasonable and naive way of looking at the world"" for people to expect companies not to profit from the vaccine. While Poonawalla has yet to match his lofty goals, there is a chance that he and SII can get back on track, which is critical to ending vaccine inequality worldwide. India has decided to begin exporting vaccines once again as its own rate of inoculation increases. The nation had administered one billion doses by October — about 90% of which came from SII, according to the company.SII also says that it has increased its production to 220 million doses a month as of October. SII is also expanding its partnerships, having signed a deal with American biotech firm Novavax to manufacture its Covid-19 vaccine, which is awaiting regulatory approvals. It's also partnering with the Russian Direct Investment Fund on production of the Sputnik vaccine."

Now, Asia's third largest economy is ready for the next big frontier in tech: Coming up with a new generation of software companies like Zoom or Slack.The Covid-19 pandemic has forced business around the world to make huge investments in digital infrastructure, furthering the influence of companies providing software-as-a-service, or SaaS. Businesses spent an extra $15 billion per week last year on tech as they scrambled to create safe remote working environments, according to a KPMG survey. TCS employs more than 500,000 people. It's ready to ditch office life for many in IndiaSaaS companies provide web-based applications that take care of everything from how secure the software is to how well it performs. Some of the world's most well-known SaaS companies include Zoom (ZM), SAP Concur and Salesforce (CRM), the American behemoth that owns workplace messaging app Slack.India's software-as-a-service industry could be worth $1 trillion in value by 2030 and create nearly half a million new jobs, according to a recent report compiled by consulting firm McKinsey & Co. and SaaSBoomi, a community of industry leaders.Read MoreThere are nearly a thousand such companies in India, of which 10 are unicorns, or startups worth at least $1 billion, the report said. ""This can be as big an opportunity as the IT services industry was in the 90s,"" said Girish Mathrubootham, CEO of Freshworks, India's best-known SaaS company. It filed for an IPO last month, joining a string of other major Indian tech unicorns that are going public this year. Freshworks was founded more than a decade ago in the southern Indian city of Chennai. Like Salesforce, it provides software to help companies manage relations with their customers. It's also India's oldest unicorn in the sector, having raised funds from investors such as Tiger Global and Accel, and has more than 50,000 customers. The company was last valued at $3.5 billion in a 2019 funding round, according to data firm Tracxn. Other Indian SaaS firms have found traction by focusing on niche businesses. Zenoti, for example, is a unicorn that builds software for the spa and beauty salon industry. Of India's 10 SaaS unicorns, six reached that milestone in 2020, and investors around the world are paying attention. Last year, investors pumped $1.5 billion into Indian SaaS companies, four times more than in 2018 or 2019, according to the SaaSBoomi report. Bullish investorsInvestors are excited about SaaS because of the ""massive adoption"" of software over the last decade, according to Mohit Bhatnagar, managing director of Sequoia Capital India.Girish Mathrubootham, CEO and founder of Freshworks, a ""SaaS"" or ""Software-as-a-service"" company founded in Chennai, India.While India is a small player in the global SaaS market, investors say the country could eventually dominate the sector because of two things: its vast pool of English-speaking developers, and the relatively low cost of hiring them.Thanks to the rise of India's IT industry, software engineering has become one of the most sought-after career options in the country. ""India actually has one of the largest developer communities in the world,"" Bhatnagar told CNN Business. Many of them have worked at some of the biggest global tech companies.Abhinav Asthana, the co-founder of Postman, pointed to his experience working as an intern at Yahoo in Bengaluru as instrumental in the decision to build his product. He came up with the idea to build a tool that would simplify the API (Application Programming Interface) testing process. An API is a programming code that defines how two applications communicate with each other, and Postman says it has made it easier for engineers to work together as they design and build their APIs. ""We saw how software was created at these global companies, and we saw API was a key problem,"" Asthana told CNN Business.Now, Postman is India's most valuable SaaS unicorn, with a valuation of $5.6 billion.International clients, Indian engineersThe low cost of operating in India is a big plus. According to a report by consulting firm Bain & Company, the salary of entry-level developers in India is 85% less than their counterparts in the United States.Abhinav Asthana, CEO and co-founder of Postman in India.""If you are building a SaaS company in the US, it is better to have a million-dollar client rather than a $10,000-client because you need to pay for sales and marketing in that country,"" said Prasanna Krishnamoorthy, managing partner at SaaS accelerator Upekkha. ""When you are serving customers from India, you can have these small and mid-sized companies, as well as large ones.""Most SaaS companies focus on global clients, similar to the strategy that was followed by India's IT giants such as TCS and Infosys (INFY). Investors see this as a welcome change, since most of India's oldest unicorns — from Flipkart to Paytm — have focused primarily on the domestic market.Almost 98% of Fortune 500 companies use Postman's products, according to Asthana, while Freshworks' first client was based in Australia. SaaS firms are much better placed to go global than e-commerce companies like India's Flipkart, for example. They write software once, and then are able to use it multiple times.India is churning out billion-dollar startups. Now they need to start making money""For a Flipkart you need billions of dollars [to grow internationally], but for a Freshwork you need much less capital to go global,"" said Mathrubootham, who is also an investor in Postman. This is because e-commerce firms require a ton of money to set up physical operations elsewhere — they have to hire delivery drivers, rent warehouses and buy inventory.Bhatnagar of Sequoia Capital said that Indian software entrepreneurs ""mastered"" the art of ""remote sales"" fairly early. ""Honestly, in this last two years, the whole world has had to understand how to do better remote sales,"" he added.Despite the euphoria, there are some hurdles Indian companies have to overcome before they can deliver on the $1 trillion promise. Indian engineers trained in the IT services industry may find it hard to develop the discipline required to build a product-focused company.In IT services, ""you are selling bodies and you say yes to everything the customer says,"" said Krishnamoorthy. SaaS companies, on the other hand, have to say no to 99% of [potential] customers, he added. And India's startup ecosytem is still relatively immature when compared to Silicon Valley. Despite the massive size of some homegrown unicorns, Mathrubootham said that the country does not have a ""global tech powerhouse product brand."" But he hoped that future SaaS companies can change that. ""It is my personal dream to see India as a product nation,"" he added."

The hype won't go away in 2022 - CNN",2021 was a dramatic year for Indian IPOs. The hype won't go away next year,"New Delhi (CNN Business)India's stock market celebrated an extraordinary year as some of the country's buzziest tech firms made their public debuts. And while one high-profile blunder cast a chill over the festivities, that's probably not enough to stop the excitement in 2022. By December, more than $15 billion had been raised in Mumbai through initial public offerings, a record amount, according to Dealogic. About $6 billion, or nearly 40%, went to tech companies — another record.This year was historic for another big reason: It's the first time any of India's tech unicorns, or startups valued at more than $1 billion, have gone public. Those milestones indicate how much of a shift happened this year for tech darlings tapping investment in Asia's third largest economy. India's unicorns have in the past focused on exclusively raising funds from private markets, fearing that the country's conservative investors would not understand their business models.Most of these high-profile startups are losing money, which was making retail investors leery, Piyush Nagda, head of investment products at Mumbai-based brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher, told CNN Business. Read MoreBut that all changed after food delivery giant Zomato made its red hot debut this summer. Nagda said the IPO sent a clear signal that ""perception is changing"" among investors.The party that started with Zomato's $1.3 billion IPO — the company popped 65% on listing day to reach a market value of $13 billion — swept up a handful of other tech firms as well. E-commerce company Nykaa and online insurance marketplace Policybazaar each surged on their debuts.The euphoria came to a screeching halt with Paytm's disastrous IPO last month. The mammoth listing from the digital payments firm crashed 27% on its first day of trading, and hasn't come close to reaching its offer price again.Despite that fiasco, which analysts blamed on the lack of a clear pathway to profitability and an overly high valuation, other Indian tech firms likely won't be stopped from going public in the coming years. They'll just have to be careful about how they price themselves and whether they're buying too much into the hype.Why the party could keep going There are a few reasons to remain hopeful about the Indian tech sector.Many of the country's digital startups saw a big jump in growth during the pandemic, both in terms of customers and funding. Coronavirus-related lockdowns have encouraged people outside of major cities to spend money online, speeding up digitization of businesses and opening up more opportunities for technology entrepreneurs.Tech firms in India have raised nearly $25 billion this year, the highest annual amount ever, according to data platform Tracxn. Some 34 companies have reached unicorn status.India has also attracted more attention from top global investors this year due to the crackdown on tech firms in China, where authorities have imposed sweeping curbs on private enterprise that have eaten into share prices and triggered concerns about future growth.As a result of those regulatory actions, ""growth investors have shifted funds to India"" said Tom Masi and Nuno Fernandes, co-portfolio managers of the emerging wealth strategy at GW&K Investment Management. They told CNN Business that the performances of the two countries have diverged this year, ""with India up about 20% and China down 20%.""China may have to juice its economy soon as 'stagflation' risk risesNagda also said that interest in Indian tech from global investors has made the sector more attractive to India's tech-savvy millennials. He estimates that India added about 20 million retail investors since April 2020, and between 30% to 40% of them are under the age of 40. They've been piling into the stock market since the pandemic started, and are eager to invest in the country's internet giants, he added. And, they should be getting plenty of opportunities next year, with some of India's biggest startups gearing up for IPOs, including Walmart-owned Flipkart and hotel chain OYO. Young investors don't look at companies in a ""traditional"" manner ""where profitability and those kind of ratios were heavily looked at,"" Nagda said, adding that there is a ""revolutionary change"" underway in stock trading in India. A wake-up callEven those investors may have their limit, though.Paytm raised $2.5 billion during its IPO, with almost half of that coming from foreign investors.The company was valued at $20 billion when it launched its public offering — even though it lost hundreds of millions of dollars last year and seemed far from ready to turn a profit.""Paytm was overpriced,"" said Masi and Fernandes. ""It required investors to make growth assumptions well into the future for a business model that has not been firmly established.""Some analysts describe Paytm's flop as a much-needed wake-up call for companies that need to rethink their valuations.""Some rationality will prevail,"" Nagda said. To see Zomato-like ""success stories,"" you need to ""price the stock rightly,"" he added.After Paytm's historically terrible debut, some companies in fintech sector are rethinking their IPOs. Paytm's smaller rival Mobikwik said it would defer its IPO, originally planned for November, by a few months. Paytm is still struggling to convince investors after disastrous IPO""The company is witnessing strong business growth, has a clear path to profitability and will list at the right time,"" it told CNN Business.Some tech entrepreneurs have urged caution while chasing big money in public markets. Nithin Kamath, founder of India's largest retail brokerage Zerodha, tweeted recently that his firm won't be filing for an IPO, even though he ""can potentially get ridiculous valuations.""""We are in a world where companies are getting priced to perfection based on all the future growth potential. For a stock to do well, you have to outperform,"" he wrote. ""As CEO, I dread to think how you can outperform the already really high expectations that growth companies have today.""Along with managing overwhelming expectations, startups that go public will also have to adjust to the amount of company information they'd be expected to regularly reveal to their new shareholders. Privately held tech giants are less beholden to such transparency. And many investors think those requirements would be a welcome change.There will be ""visibility into this for the very, very first time,"" said Karthik Reddy, co-founder of venture capital firm Blume Ventures. ""Even I don't know what was going on in all these companies, even though I'm an industry person."""

President Biden on Friday issued an executive order prohibiting imports of certain products originating in Russia. They include fish, seafood, luxury goods, alcoholic beverages and nonindustrial diamonds.The ban directly targets Alrosa, which the US government identified as the world's largest diamond mining company, responsible for 90 percent of Russia's diamond mining capacity and accounting for 28%, or nearly a third, of global diamond output. In 2021, Alrosa supplied 32.4 million carats of diamonds. Alrosa is partly owned by the Russian government and its shares trade on the Moscow Stock Exchange.Alrosa accouts for as much as a third of the global output of rough diamonds.""This is a very big deal and a once-in-a-lifetime situation for the diamond industry,"" said Tiffany Stevens, CEO and general counsel of the Jewelers Vigilance Committee (JVC), a 105-year-old non-profit that advocates for the US jewelry industry and provides legal education and compliance guidance to its 600 individual members.Read MoreOn Friday, JVC advised its members that any US business purchasing diamonds directly from a Russian company should immediately halt the transactions. The warning specifically mentioned Alrosa and Alrosa USA.At the same time, JVC said it isn't clear how US Customs will treat imports of polished diamonds that come from other countries but originated in Russia. A raw diamond can touch many countries as it goes from an uncut gem to a beguiling necklace or ring. ""The issue is 'what is considered of Russian origin?'"" Stevens said. ""It can originate in Russia and is then cut and polished in India. Is it then considered an Indian diamond at that point?"" The diamond industry would benefit from further guidance from the US government on how the new policy would be applied, she added. Adding pressureThe ban on Russian diamonds is an escalation of the sanctions first applied by the US in late February and could lead to acute diamond supply chain disruptions, said Paul Zimnisky, an independent diamond industry analyst.As part of that initial set of sanctions, the US Treasury listed major state-owned and private entities that it believes are critical to the Russian economy. Included on the list is Alrosa and, separately, its CEO, Sergei S. Ivanov. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said Ivanov is the son of Sergei B. Ivanov, reportedly one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest allies.The surprising reason perfume prices are skyrocketingThe Treasury Department said sanctions against Alrosa will heavily restrict the company's ability to raise money through the US market -- a key source of capital and revenue generation -- limiting the Russian government's ability to fund the further invasion of Ukraine.Although the first wave of sanctions didn't outright ban companies from buying diamonds from Russia, they complicated businesses' ability to pay for them since many of Russia's banks have been expelled from the international banking system SWIFT, said Zimnisky.""(The sanctions) would draw out the delivery of rough diamonds by weeks, potentially months, to manufacturers who cut and polish the diamonds,"" he said. For example, India -- which accounts for 90% of all diamond cutting and polishing in the world -- would immediately feel the impact. The delays of up to three to six months will then make their way to retailers who buy the polished diamonds, he said.A view of Botuobinsky diamond mining pit of Nakyn diamond ore field, some 340 kms northeast  from the town of Mirny.The ban now means US businesses can't buy Russian diamonds at all and will have to source Canadian, African, Brazilian or Australian diamonds, said Zimnisky.Another hurdle he anticipates layered on top of the hard-hitting government sanctions are ""self sanctions,"" stemming from the moral and ethical stance that consumers themselves may adopt. ""For many retailers, up to a third of their existing diamond inventory is of Russian origin,"" he said.Fine jewelry seller Brilliant Earth tweeted last month that it had removed all Russian mined diamonds from its website and that it hoped for a ""peaceful and swift resolution in Ukraine."" Signet Jewelers, one of the largest sellers of diamond jewelry in the world, said it suspended business interaction with Russian-owned entities at the beginning of the invasion, ""in unity with all those in the world calling for peace.""Signet (SIG) operates jewelry chains Zales, Jared, Kay Jewelers and Diamonds Direct under its corporate umbrella.Alrosa last week suspended its own membership in the Natural Diamond Council, a diamond industry group that promotes and markets the use of natural diamonds. Its members include leading diamond producers De Beers and Dominion Diamond Mines. Diamond supply already tightThe threat of disruptions to the diamond supply chain comes as the industry is already experiencing record global demand for diamonds and supply is at a decade-low level.""Demand has been so robust over the past two years that there is essentially no excess inventory of diamonds right now,"" said Zimnisky.Jewelry purchases, and diamond jewelry, in particular, saw a boost through the pandemic, spurred by stimulus check spending and a build up of savings as Covid restrictions prevented other types of discretionary activities, such as travel and dining out.Retail sales of diamond jewelry jumped 29% last year versus 2020 and were up 11% over 2019, according to a new report from consulting firm Bain & Company. Bain expects demand for diamond jewelry and polished and rough diamonds to continue to grow through the first half of this year. ""In 2022 the market is expected to demonstrate growth higher than the pre-pandemic period and return to historic growth pace by 2023-24,"" the report said.Man-made diamonds are the new engagement ring trendZimnisky anticipates that the weight of geopolitical tension will affect diamond prices. ""The time to watch is midyear, when businesses start to stock up on diamonds in preparation of holiday demand. I think that's when the shortages will be felt most,"" he said.Martin Rapaport, founder of diamond industry research publication Rapaport Diamond Report and chair of the Rapaport Group which provides services to the diamond industry, sees the situation somewhat differently.""Shortages of wheat, oil and other essentials and their impact on inflation will have a greater effect on diamond prices than any shortages of diamonds,"" he said."

Global neon consumption for chip production reached about 540 metric tons last year, Techcet estimates.Both firms have shuttered their operations, according to company representatives contacted by Reuters, as Russian troops have escalated their attacks on cities throughout Ukraine, killing civilians and destroying key infrastructure.The stoppage casts a cloud over the worldwide output of chips, already in short supply after the coronavirus pandemic drove up demand for cell phones, laptops and later cars, forcing some firms to scale back production.While estimates vary widely about the amount of neon stocks chipmakers keep on hand, production could take a hit if the conflict drags on, according to Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA.Read More""If stockpiles are depleted by April and chipmakers don't have orders locked up in other regions of the world, it likely means further constraints for the broader supply chain and inability to manufacture the end-product for many key customers,"" he said.Before the invasion, Ingas produced 15,000 to 20,000 cubic meters of neon per month for customers in Taiwan, Korea, China, the United States and Germany, with about 75% going to the chip industry, Nikolay Avdzhy, the company's chief commercial officer, said in an email to Reuters.The company is based in Mariupol, which has been under siege by Russian forces. On Wednesday, Russian forces destroyed a maternity hospital there, in what Kyiv and Western allies called a war crime. Moscow said the hospital was no longer functioning and had been occupied by Ukrainian fighters.""Civilians are suffering,"" Avdzhy said by email last Friday, noting that the company's marketing officer could not respond because he had no internet or phone access.Cryoin, which produced roughly 10,000 to 15,000 cubic meters of neon per month, and is located in Odessa, halted operations on Feb. 24 when the attacks began to keep employees safe, according to business development director Larissa Bondarenko.Bondarenko said the company would be unable to fill orders for 13,000 cubic meter of neon in March unless the violence stopped. She said the company could weather at least three months with the plant closed, but warned that if equipment were damaged, that would prove a bigger drag on company finances and make it harder to restart operations quickly.She also said she was unsure the company could access additional raw materials for making neon.Taiwan's Economy Ministry, in a statement to Reuters, said Taiwanese firms had already made advanced preparations and had ""safety stocks"" of neon, so it did not see any problems in the supply chain in the near term.Russia-Ukraine crisis replaces Covid as top risk to global supply chains, Moody's saysTaiwan's central bank made similar comments earlier on Friday.Ukrainian neon is a byproduct of Russian steel manufacturing. The gas, which is also used in laser eye surgery, is produced in China as well, but Chinese prices are rising steadily.Bondarenko says prices, already under pressure after the pandemic, had climbed by up to 500% from December. According to a Chinese media report that cited Chinese commodity market information provider biiinfo.com, the price of neon gas (99.9% content) in China has quadrupled from 400 yuan/cubic meter in October last year to more than 1,600 yuan/cubic meter in late February.Neon prices rose 600% in the run-up to Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission.Companies elsewhere could initiate neon production but it would take nine months to two years to ramp up, according to Richard Barnett, chief marketing officer of Supplyframe, which provides market intelligence to companies across the global electronics sectors.But CFRA's Angelo Zino noted that companies may be unwilling to invest in that process if the supply crunch is seen as temporary."

","business, Soaring nickel prices could be the next major headache for automakers - CNN",Soaring nickel prices could be the next major headache for automakers,"London (CNN Business)Nickel prices have soared to all-time highs in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, threatening the global transition to electric vehicles. The London Metal Exchange suspended trading in nickel on Tuesday for the first time in its 145-year history after prices doubled in a matter of hours to $100,000 per metric ton.Prices eased back to about $80,000 per metric ton. But that's still far above the previous record of $52,000 per metric ton set in 2007. The metal is a key component in lithium-ion batteries used in EVs, and is one of several commodities that have spiked in price since Russia attacked its neighbor. Markets fear Western sanctions will limit exports from the region, resulting in supply shocks. Russia is the world's third biggest supplier of nickel behind Indonesia and the Philippines, making up about 13% of global mining capacity in 2021, according to Rystad Energy. Read More''The breathtaking rise of commodities is causing a whirlwind of anxiety on financial markets and exchanges, as traders speculate about the knock on effects of the Ukraine conflict,"" Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a research note on Tuesday. The rapid rise in nickel prices may have been caused by a short squeeze, said Streeter.Rising nickel prices are another potential headache for automakers who have spent the past year grappling with supply chain disruptions, plant shutdowns and a shortage of semiconductor chips.  James Ley, senior vice president of energy metals at Rystad Energy, told CNN Business that the nickel price surge was ""unprecedented"" and could theoretically push the cost of some EV batteries up by a third. But automakers are unlikely to feel the impact immediately as many will have locked in nickel prices through long-term contracts, he said. ""I think we need to see where nickel will eventually settle in price before fully understanding the long-term implications,"" Ley said. Global EV sales boomed last year, but higher battery or vehicle prices would cast doubt over whether the speed of the transition away from internal combustion engines can be maintained. Al Bedwell, director of global powertrain at LMC Automotive, said he expects nickel prices to stay elevated for some time. But surging oil and gasoline prices mean that people who were considering an electric car may not be easily dissuaded.""Whatever fuel one chooses, the cost of personal mobility will increase,"" Bedwell said."

","business, Wheat futures are soaring, and food prices could be next - CNN",Wheat futures are soaring. Food prices could be next,"New York (CNN Business)Russia's attack on Ukraine is causing wheat prices to spike, exacerbating already high food prices. Wheat futures were up about 5.35% Tuesday, reaching prices not seen since 2008. The higher prices make wheat more expensive for food makers, who will likely pass those costs on to consumers. Ukraine and Russia together are responsible for about 14% of global wheat production, according to Gro Intelligence, an agricultural data analytics firm. The two countries supply about 29% of all wheat exports. Prior to the Russian invasion, Ukraine was on track for a record year of wheat exports, while Russia's wheat exports were slowing, according to the US Department of Agriculture.""This could not come have come in the worse time,"" said Robb MacKie, president and CEO of American Bakers Association. With wheat prices already on the rise, the conflict abroad is placing even more pressure on a still ailing supply chain. Russia is the top exporter or wheat, while Ukraine is in the top 5. The two counties compete in export markets like Egypt, Turkey, and Bangladesh.Read More""Depending on how this comes out and how long it goes, wheat farmers [in Ukraine] may not be able to plant spring wheat, corn and other things. So, they might go a year without any crops,"" MacKie added.That will likely push prices on US consumer items like cereal and bread higher. Cereal and baked goods were up 6.8% in the last year because of inflation, according to the US Labor Department. Consumer prices usually lag market prices of wheat, corn, grain -- as these commodity prices are contracted in advance. That means the impact may not be felt for weeks or months.

Russia's actions also have caused a major disruption to Ukrainian ports, hobbling the export market. ""You've got all kinds of logistical restrictions,"" said Jim Heneghan, SVP of Agribusiness at Gro Intelligence. For example, ""Ukrainian ports [are] closed to commercial traffic,"" Heneghan said. And there also are reports of commercial ships being attacked. The disruptions are tightening global wheat supplies, even as demand stays the same or spikes. And with less supply, prices are rising even more than they have during the pandemic.  Global food prices rose as much as 28% in 2021, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Supply chain disruptions and extreme weather contributed to the higher prices. The current situation ""is just adding to additional food price inflation that we've been witnessing,"" Heneghan said. US food prices are not immune Most US consumer brands don't rely on imported ingredients, said Katie Denis, who leads communications and research for the Consumer Brands Association, a US trade group. ""For the US market, we only import about 8% of the total stuff needed for the [consumer packaged goods] industry,"" she said. ""It's pretty minimal."" Most imported items come from Mexico and Canada, she added. Higher wheat prices are good news for US farmers, as more demand could shift to the US. Even so, although US companies may not have direct exposure to disruptions in Ukraine, they aren't immune from them, either. ""This is a global economy,"" Denis said. ""The pricing pressure will be something felt across the entire world."" Gro Intellligence's Heneghan said that as global supply tightens, US wheat farmers could export more product. ""A lot of times, you'll see the demand come back to the US ... when you have global events that shut down exportable surpluses,"" he said. ""But it comes at a higher price."" That could be good news for US farmers, he added, but not for consumers.Wheat grows in a field near Uzhhorod, in the Zakarpattia region of Western Ukraine, in July 2020.""Over the next few months, you'll see what food companies ... will have to do with the higher prices they're having to contend with,"" Heneghan said. Food and consumer goods producers may choose to absorb some of the price hikes, but they are more likely to continue to pass them onto consumers, he noted. The producer price index, which tracks average price changes America's producers get paid for their goods and services, rose 9.7% in the 12 months ended in January, not adjusted for seasonal swings, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in February.And they're likely to raise prices further as input costs rise, Heneghan said, especially because wheat isn't the only crop that's getting more expensive.Other agricultural commodity prices are going up, such as corn and soybeans, not to mention oil.

With less of those two essential agricultural ingredients, he expects knock-on effects for global food supplies. ""It's not whether we are going to have a food crisis. It's how large that crisis will be,"" Holsether told CNN Business.Two weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, the prices of key agricultural products produced in the region have skyrocketed. The biggest problem is wheat, a pantry staple. Supplies from Russia and Ukraine, which together account for almost 30% of global wheat trade, are now at risk. Global wheat prices hit an all-time high earlier this week.Wheat futures are soaring. Food prices could be nextAnother major problem is access to fertilizer. Essential for farmers to hit their production targets for crops, it's never been more expensive, as exports from Russia grind to a halt. Output in Europe has also plunged thanks to the surging price of natural gas, a key ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers like urea.Read MoreThe situation is ringing alarm bells for global health experts. The cost of corn, soybeans and vegetable oils has been jumping, too.Agriculture ministers from the G7 countries said Friday they ""remain determined to do what is necessary to prevent and respond to a food crisis.""But fearing shortages, countries are already turning inward, which could ultimately leave less food for those in need. Egypt just banned the export of wheat, flour, lentils and beans amid growing concerns over food reserves in the Arab world's most populous state. Indonesia has also tightened export restrictions on palm oil, which is a component in cooking oil as well as in cosmetics and some packaged goods like chocolate. It's the world's top producer of the product. The G7 ministers called on countries to ""keep their food and agricultural markets open and to guard against any unjustified restrictive measures on their exports.""""Any further increase in food price levels and volatility in international markets could threaten food security and nutrition at a global scale, especially among the most vulnerable living in environments of low food security,"" they said in a statement.Western countries with more access to agriculture will be hurt, too. Consumers there have already been stung by higher prices, and the situation is poised to deteriorate further.Russia, Ukraine and global food suppliesEven before Russia launched a war in Ukraine, the global food system was strained. Snarled supply chains and unpredictable weather patterns — often the result of climate change — had already pushed food prices to their highest level in about a decade. Affordability was also an issue after the pandemic left millions out of work.The number of people on the edge of famine has jumped to 44 million from 27 million in 2019, the UN's World Food Programme said this month.The conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which both play crucial roles in the carefully calibrated system of global food production, stands to make the situation worse.Global wheat prices have fallen from record highs in recent days, but remain elevated. They're expected to stay that way for some time, according to Rabobank commodity analyst Carlos Mera.The wheat planting season, which is about to begin in Ukraine, will be disrupted by fighting. It's not clear there will be enough farmers to till the land, as people in the country take up arms — or whether they'll be able to access machinery and other essential products that would typically arrive through Black Sea ports.""It's anyone's guess if Ukraine will be able to export anything for the rest of this year, or next year, or in the foreseeable future,"" Mera said. The country also accounts for half of all exports of sunflower oil.Getting products from Russia onto the world market has also gotten more difficult, because businesses don't want to risk running afoul of sanctions or deal with the logistics of traveling near a war zone.Russia and Ukraine serve as the breadbasket for countries in the Middle East and North Africa that depend on imports. Many will be hit hard as a result. The United States and Europe will feel the pain, too, since the run-up in prices for important agricultural goods will affect businesses that produce food in every market.""Any serious disruption of production and exports from these suppliers will no doubt drive up prices further and erode food security for millions of people,"" the Agricultural Market Information System said in a recent report.Fertilizer costs soarThe brewing crisis goes beyond wheat and oils. Russia, along with its ally Belarus, is also a major exporter of the fertilizers needed to plant a wide range of crops. But right now, everyone is shunning their stock. ""Nobody wants to touch a Russian product right now,"" said Deepika Thapliyal, a fertilizer expert at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services. ""If you look at all of the traders, all of the buyers, they're very scared.""The price of natural gas is exacerbating the issue. Fertilizer producers outside of Russia and Belarus need gas to make nitrogen-based products like urea, which is used when sowing crops to boost yield and even promotes their deep-green color. But Holsether, the CEO of Yara, said costs have gotten too high to keep operations running at scale. He's not sure when European production will be at full capacity again.""There's a large part of the industry that's at risk of not being able to deliver products to the farmers, and that will have an impact on the crop yields quite rapidly,"" he said.Farmers have the incentive right now to pay what they need to get fertilizer, since prices for their products are going up, too. Not everyone has this option, however. Urea has been trading near $1,000 per metric ton, about four times the price at the start of 2021, according to Chris Lawson, the head of fertilizers at CRU Group, a market intelligence firm.Countries without domestic fertilizer production may also struggle to access it, with huge consequences for the global food system.""You can't grow massive fields of wheat, barley or soy without fertilizer,"" said Johanna Mendelson Forman, a professor at American University who specializes in war and food. Farmers in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil are already worried about shortages, she added.The consequencesOn Monday, Russian fertilizer and coal billionaire Andrey Melnichenko broke with President Vladimir Putin and called for peace in Ukraine, noting that a global food crisis looms.The war ""has already led to soaring prices in fertilizers which are no longer affordable to farmers,"" Melnichenko told Reuters. ""Now it will lead to even higher food inflation in Europe and likely food shortages in the world's poorest countries,"" he added.The G7 agriculture ministers said Friday that their countries would leverage humanitarian aid where they can to mitigate fallout from the war. But they may also be hamstrung by a dearth of supplies and rising prices.""If Ukrainian fields lie fallow this year, aid agencies such as ours will be forced to source new markets to compensate for the loss of some of the world's best wheat,"" David Beasley, executive director of the World Food Programme, said in an op-ed published in the Washington Post this week. ""Doing so will come at a vastly inflated cost.""Beasley noted that Ukrainian wheat has also been essential to feeding populations in other countries facing conflict, including Afghanistan, Sudan and Yemen. ""The vast majority of wheat is used for human consumption, and that's irreplaceable,"" Rabobank's Mera said.And it won't just be countries grappling with famine or war that feel the effects. The affordability of food is a problem for lower-income shoppers everywhere, Mendelson Forman emphasized. In April 2021, about one in seven American adults experienced food insecurity over the past 30 days, according to the Urban Institute.""We're used to a globalized system of trade to get all kinds of varieties of food,"" she said. ""People will see it in their pocketbooks, and they'll see it in the grocery stores.""— Mostafa Salem contributed reporting."

","business, These apps are trying to put car dealers out of business - CNN",These apps are trying to put car dealers out of business,"London (CNN Business)City dwellers are used to switching between apps to decide the best way to get from A to B. Is it quickest to get the train or the bus? What about a taxi or a city bike? Which provider has the nearest e-scooter?It can be inconvenient and time consuming. Which is why Finnish startup MaaS Global decided to aggregate all these services into one app called Whim. Available in more than 10 cities across Europe and Asia, users can access taxis, buses, bikes, e-scooters and rental cars. ""Whim's sole purpose is to compete against car ownership,"" CEO Sampo Hietanen tells CNN Business.According to the International Energy Agency, transport is responsible for 24% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, most of which come from passenger vehicles. If Whim can persuade users to trade their car keys for a single app offering multiple transport options, the environmental impact could be enormous, says Hietanen. Car competitionRead MoreHe admits this isn't an easy task. To succeed Whim has to be more convenient and cheaper than owning a car. ""The car represents freedom of mobility,"" says Hietanen — even if a city dweller barely uses it, they still keep it parked outside as a ""freedom insurance.""To compete, Whim offers rental cars and taxis, but Hietanen says that users tend to opt for public transport or micromobility (shared lightweight vehicles such as bikes or e-scooters). The app was launched in Helsinki but is now available in several European and Asian cities.Users can choose between multiple tiers of service, including a pay-as-you-go option and a 30-day season ticket, which costs €62 ($73) in Helsinki — where the app is most established — for unlimited public transport and short taxi rides. The ticket also offers car rental from €55 ($65) per day.While Helsinki has well-developed alternatives to driving, that's not true of everywhere. If a city ""does not have a wide public transport system or a lot of rental cars or taxis in place"" then it will be difficult to convince people to give up their cars, says Maria Kamargianni, associate professor of transport and energy at University College London.She says apps like Whim represent the first step in tempting people away from car ownership, and adds that the availability of alternative transport options is likely to improve as the market matures. Research firm MarketsandMarkets predicts the global mobility service market will grow from $4.7 billion in 2020 to $70.4 billion by 2030. MaaS movementOther providers include Citymapper, which launched a travel pass for Londoners in 2019, and Moovit, which launched an all-in-one mobility app in Israel last year. Whim, launched in 2016, is one of the earliest providers and has raised more than $60 million from investors such as BP (BP), Mitsubishi (MBFJF) and Toyota Financial Services. It's available in several European cities and in Tokyo, and has racked up 18 million trips globally since launch. But the business has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, says Hietanen; with fewer people traveling, revenues are lower, stalling the company's expansion into other cities.According to Whim, public transport and micromobility are the most popular ways to travel using the app. Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat recently reported that the company had spent €50 million ($59 million) on failed expansion ventures. Hietanen says the money was spent on integrating multiple transportation providers, establishing market readiness in several countries, and developing the complex technology that underpins the app. ""We've known from the beginning that the investment needed to create this would be substantial,"" he says, adding that the company has recently secured further investment. Greener travelThough the industry is in its infancy, Hietanen is confident the demand will be there. A recent report from the International Transport Forum (ITF) says that mobility services will be vital in meeting the needs of a growing world population and fast-paced urbanization. But for growth to happen, ""people must choose it over other travel options"" such as private motor vehicles.This is already happening, says Hietanen. According to a company survey carried out in Helsinki, 12% of its users said that Whim had prompted them to give up their cars. ""People want the more sustainable solution,"" he says, ""but they still want the freedom of being able to go anywhere, anytime."""

But despite covering more than 70% of the Earth's surface, the ocean is still a relative mystery. In fact, we know more about the surface of Mars than we do about the sea floor; just over 20% of the ocean bed has been mapped.  Getting a fuller picture would enable us to navigate ships more safely, create more accurate climate models, lay down telecommunication cables, build offshore windfarms and protect marine species -- all part of what's known as the ""blue economy,"" projected to be worth $3 trillion by 2030.Underwater robotic vehicles equipped with sensors are helping gather that data quicker and more cheaply than ever before. But many of these vehicles rely on batteries with a limited lifespan, and need to return to a boat or the shore to recharge, making it difficult for them to map more remote parts of the sea. A five-year-old startup called Seatrec is rising to the challenge, founded by oceanographer Yi Chao. While working at NASA, he developed technology to power ocean robots by harnessing ""the naturally occurring temperature difference"" of the sea, Chao told CNN Business. Greener and cheaperRead MoreThe power module can be installed on existing data-gathering robots or Seatrec's own floating device. This dives a kilometer down to examine the chemistry and shape of the seabed, using sonar to create a map of the surrounding area. The robot returns to the surface to send back its findings via satellite.Seatrec's float uses differences in ocean temperature to power itself.As the float moves between colder and warmer parts of the ocean, material inside the module either melts or solidifies, causing pressure that in turn creates thermal energy and powers the robot's generator.""They get charged by the sea, so they can extend their lifetime almost indefinitely,"" Chao said.This underwater concrete attracts marine life and gets stronger at the same timeA basic float model typically costs around $20,000. Attaching Seatrec's energy system adds another $25,000, Chao said.But the access to free, renewable energy and the ability to stay in the water longer makes data gathering up to five times cheaper in the long run, according to Chao. He said the startup is making fewer than 100 devices per year, primarily for marine researchers, but the technology is easily scalable -- Seatrec's energy module can also be can be retrofitted onto existing mapping devices to extend their range. Picking up the paceNew technologies that can extend the reach of data-gathering devices are crucial for mapping more remote parts of the deep sea, according Jamie McMichael-Phillips, director of the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project. ""One of the huge challenges we have is quite simply physics,"" said McMichael-Phillips. ""Unlike mapping the Earth's surface where we can use a camera [or] satellites, at sea, light does not penetrate through the water column. So we're pretty much limited to using sonar systems."" How 3D printing could help save Hong Kong's coralLaunched in 2017, the Seabed 2030 Project has increased awareness about the importance of the ocean floor, and given researchers and companies a clear goal to work towards: map the entire seafloor by the end of this decade. Some companies, such as XOCEAN, are surveying the ocean from the surface. Another startup, Bedrock Ocean Exploration, says it can provide surveys of seabed areas up to 10 times faster than traditional methods by using an autonomous electric submarine fitted with sonars, cameras and lasers; the data is then analyzed on Bedrock's own cloud platform.Bedrock Ocean Exploration uses an autonomous electric submarine fitted with sonars, cameras and lasers.The challenge aheadEven with the growing number of technologies accelerating seabed exploration, completing the map is still a logistical and financial challenge. This vegan 'tech-style' startup wants to make clothes using algae Chao estimates that it would take 3,000 of Seatrec's floats operating over the next 10 years to fully survey the ocean. The company has raised $2 million in seed funding to scale up production of its energy harvesting system.But this is a drop in the ocean of the capital needed to fully survey the ocean, which is estimated to be ""somewhere between $3 to $5 billion,"" according to McMichael-Phillips -- ""pretty much the same order of magnitude as the cost of sending a mission to Mars.""Bedrock's DiMare believes it's time we start investing in our own planet.""If we want to keep Earth as a place that humans can live,"" he said, ""we have got to get a lot smarter about what's going on in the ocean."""

Covid-19 cases were up 48% in the UK last week compared with the week before. Hospitalizations were up 17% over the same period. The country's daily case rate -- about 55,000 a day -- is still less than a third of the Omicron peak, but cases are rising as fast as they were falling just two weeks earlier, when the country removed pandemic-related restrictions.  Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Is America ready to take the next step in its Covid-19 recovery?Daily cases are also rising in more than half of the countries in the European Union. They've jumped 48% in the Netherlands and 20% in Germany over the past week, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. But daily cases in Germany had yet to drop below pre-Omicron levels, and the Netherlands hadn't seen cases fall as much as they did in the UK.  The situation in Europe has the attention of public health officials for two reasons: First, the UK offers a preview of what may play out in the United States, and second, something unusual seems to be happening. In previous waves, increases in Covid hospitalizations lagged behind jumps in cases by about 10 days to two weeks. Now, in the UK, cases and hospitalizations seem to be rising in tandem, something that has experts stumped.Read More""So we're obviously keenly interested in what's going on with that,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN.  Fauci said he's spoken with his UK counterparts, and they have pegged the rise to a combination three factors. In order of contribution, Fauci said, these are:The BA.2 variant, which is more transmissible than the original Omicron The opening of society, with people mingling more indoors without masksWaning immunity from vaccination or prior infectionIn a technical briefing Friday, the UK Health Security Agency said BA.2 had an 80% higher relative growth rate than the original Omicron strain, though it does not seem more likely to lead to hospitalization.  White House warns of 'severe consequences' if Congress doesn't pass supplemental Covid fundingGiven that BA.2 doesn't seem to be causing more severe disease -- at least not in the highly vaccinated British population -- it's not clear why hospitalizations are ticking up.""The issue with hospitalization is a little bit more puzzling, because although the hospitalizations are going up, it is very clear their use of ICU beds has not increased,"" Fauci said. ""So are the numbers of hospitalizations a real reflection of Covid cases, or is there a difficulty deciphering between people coming into the hospital with Covid or because of Covid?"" The US, like the UK, has lifted most mitigation measures as Covid-19 infections have fallen. Two weeks ago, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed how it measures Covid-19 impact in communities. The new metric -- which relies on hospitalizations and hospital capacity in addition to cases -- did away with masking recommendations for most parts of the country. States and schools have followed suit, lifting indoor masking requirements.READ: Your top Covid questions, answered""Without a doubt, opening up society and having people mingle indoors is clearly something that is a contributor, as well as overall waning immunity, which means we've really got to stay heads-up and keep our eye on the pattern here,"" Fauci said. ""So that's the reason why we're watching this very carefully.""Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told CNN, ""it's like a weather alert. Right now, the skies are sunny and bright, and we hope they stay that way. But we could have some bad weather by evening, and we just don't know.""What will BA.2 do in the US?BA.2 has been growing steadily in the US. Last week, the CDC estimated it was causing about 12% of new Covid-19 cases here.  Meanwhile, BA.2 now accounts for more than 50% of cases in the UK and several other European countries.""The tipping point seems to be right around 50%,"" said Keri Althoff, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""That's when we really start to see that variant flex its power in the population"" as far as showing its severity.Covid-19 cases continue to rise in China's worst outbreak since WuhanAlthoff said although the UK may provide a glimpse of the future, there are key differences that will affect how BA.2 plays out in the United States.In the UK, 86% of eligible people are fully vaccinated, and 67% are boosted, compared with 69% of those eligible vaccinated and 50% boosted in the US. ""What we see happening in the UK is going to be perhaps a better story than what we should be expecting here,"" Althoff said.In the Netherlands, it took about a month for BA.2 to overpower BA.1, she noted. If the same timeline occurs in the US, that will mean the variant is taking off just as the immunity generated by winter's Omicron infections will be waning. Coronavirus wastewater data, CDC guidelines can give mixed signals on whether to mask""I'm concerned about that,"" Althoff said. ""But we were in a similar situation last spring, where we really got hopeful that things were going to settle down, and we got a little bit of a summer, and then we got walloped by Delta.""It will be important for people to understand they may be able to take their masks off for a few weeks, Althoff said, but they might also need to go back to wearing them regularly if cases spike.""We could see another wave of illness at our hospitals,"" she said.Althoff will also be closely watching wastewater data over the next few weeks.  ""Wastewater surveillance is an incredible advancement in how we can monitor SARS-CoV-2 and what it's doing in the population without needing, really, any input from people,"" she said. ""Keeping our eye on wastewater surveillance is an important tool to understand where the virus is going and if it's increasing in terms of infection.""Preparing for the next waveProtection against the next variant has to start with vaccination.""We absolutely have to continue to find people who are unvaccinated and get them vaccinated,"" Althoff said.Fauci agreed vaccination rates could be better in all age groups, but current numbers are especially bad for kids: Only about a third of kids ages 5 to 11 have been vaccinated and only about half of kids ages 12 to 17.Even though the youngest children, those under 5, can't yet be vaccinated, recent studies have shown young kids are less likely to catch Covid-19 when they're surrounded by vaccinated adults.Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.""So the way you protect them is to surround the children, to the extent possible, with people who are vaccinated and boosted so that you have somewhat a veil of protection around them,"" Fauci said.It will also be important to continue to be flexible.""The important thing in this massive experiment where we're dropping all masking and restrictions is we have to stay diligent in terms of monitoring of it and testing and be prepared to possibly reverse a lot of the relaxing of these restrictions,"" said Deborah Fuller, a microbiologist at the University of Washington.""We can't let our guard down, because the message that people get when they say 'we're lifting restrictions' is the pandemic is over. And it's not,"" she said."

Vaccines still do a good job of keeping people alive and out of the hospital. There's increasing access to tests and treatments. The numbers of cases, hospitalizations and deaths are heading in the right direction.If living in a Covid world has taught us anything, however, it's that the coronavirus can surprise even the smartest public health experts, and the world certainly isn't out of the woods yet.A new variant could easily develop and slip past the protection of current treatments and vaccines, setting us back to what life was like in 2020. That makes it hard to predict what happens next week, let alone in a few months. However, based on what they're seeing now, here's what the experts think could happen in the next year of the pandemic. Each of these predictions has an unspoken ""variant depending"" at the end.What will spring and summer be like?Read MoreThe numbers in the US look good. Only 2% of the US population -- that's about 7 million  people -- lives in a county with a ""high"" Covid-19 community level, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rest are at ""low"" or ""medium"" community levels, areas where there's no recommendation to wear a mask or where the immunocompromised should take extra precautions.In fact, over the next four weeks, the CDC forecasts decreases in hospitalizations and deaths. The trend could continue, particularly as the weather improves and people head outside, where it's less likely that they'll catch Covid.These positive trends could mean the US will see a normal or at least near-normal spring and summer (variant depending, of course). She had a near-death experience because of Covid. But it wasn't a glimpse of an afterlife that changed her""I am very optimistic,"" said Dr. William Lang, WorldClinic medical director and former White House deputy physician. ""I'm optimistic for what things look like for everybody being able to get back to normal activities over the summer.""But normal doesn't mean a return to pre-2020 life. ""Fewer"" cases still mean tens of thousands of Americans are getting infected. And as of Friday, even with deaths at the lowest level in three months, there are an average of about 1,200 Americans dying from Covid-19 each day, according to Johns Hopkins University. ""Everyone has to recognize, relatively speaking, we're still very early in this, right? This is not going away,"" said Dr. Abraar Karan, an infectious disease fellow in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine at Stanford University. Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Is America ready to take the next step in its Covid-19 recovery?If the pandemic moves into more of an endemic phase, meaning enough people have immune protection through natural infection and vaccination, it doesn't mean you can burn your masks. Rather, it means the spread of Covid will slow and result in fewer deaths and hospitalizations. But this state of endemicity is not guaranteed.One metric to watch is a rising trend in cases and hospitalizations in the UK. Karan thinks that is mainly happening because of waning immunity, and the US could see similar trends.""With the combination of our immunity waning and the virus mutating, future surges are unpredictable,"" Karan said.  What about autumn and winter?With the unpredictability of the coronavirus, it's hard to know what will happen in the fall and winter, said David Montefiori, a virologist at Duke University Medical Center.READ: You asked, we're answering: Your top questions about Covid-19""This virus has thrown us some real curveballs,"" Montefiori said. Some experts say the coronavirus could eventually become seasonal like flu, but he doesn't think it's there yet. ""Thinking of this as a seasonal virus like flu, that hasn't been the case so far. The variants seem to be periodic,"" Montefiori said. ""Roughly every four to six months, we have a new variant."" Pandemic at two years: Covid-19 news no longer dominates front pagesHe is optimistic, though, because Americans have so much immunity built up through vaccination, infection or a combination of the two. ""We might have another surge later this year, even early summer, but if there isn't one, that's saying the immunity we've built up as a population is doing a good job.""The concern, of course, is that a variant emerges that escapes the vaccines. ""The good news is that vaccines can be quickly modified,"" Montefiori said.  With more access to tests and treatments now, many experts believe that the US is better prepared for a fall or winter surge than it was last year. Some say Covid-19 cases could climb for a while when colder weather sends people back inside and as they become more complacent about taking precautions. ""Ultimately, the virus is going to have a tough time in our population, but it's going to take a long time,"" said Dr. John Swartzberg, a clinical professor emeritus at UC Berkeley's School of Public Health. ""I think the real long view is, endemicity is going to be the case. Eradication is not possible.""Much depends on how quickly the planet can get vaccinated, Swartzberg said. The more people are vaccinated, the fewer there are to serve as hosts where the virus can mutate and produce -- you guessed it -- variants. Less than 10% of people in low-income countries are vaccinated, according to the International Rescue Committee. The US and other countries have pledged to send more vaccines overseas this year.    What's next for vaccines for adults?You may be need a fourth shot of the Covid-19 vaccine this year. The CDC already recommends that those who have weakened immune systems get one. Public health officials in the US have said they are very carefully monitoring if, or when, a fourth dose may be needed for the broader population, with a potential fall timeline in mind.The vaccines still seem to protect against hospitalization and death, particularly if you are boosted, but protection could wane over time and is a little less effective against the Omicron variant. The currently authorized boosters are made to protect against the original coronavirus from late 2019.The next vaccines could be specifically tuned to the variant -- or variants -- that are in circulation, Moderna Chief Medical Officer Dr. Paul Burton said Wednesday. Or they could be a combination shot.Moderna and Pfizer have confirmed that they are testing vaccines that focus on Omicron. This is no time to drop the ball on Covid-19Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said his company will soon submit data on another vaccine dose for federal health officials to consider. ""I think our data suggests that they're protecting, they are improving dramatically the protection, the fourth dose compared to the third, for Omicron after some time, after let's say three to six months,"" Bourla said in a Washington Post Live discussion on Thursday. Globally, there are 234 other Covid-19 vaccines in development. Perhaps furthest along in the process is the one from Novavax. It is in the middle of the regulatory process with the FDA and could be authorized this year.What's next for vaccines for kids?Pfizer and Moderna are expected to report results from their trials involving children under the age of 5 in the next few weeks. Pfizer is also working on trials of a third vaccine dose for children ages 5 to 11. Children 12 and older can already get a third shot, as can kids 5 and older who are immunocompromised. For the littlest kids, scientists think a vaccine may not be authorized until April. Pfizer originally said it thought it could have one out earlier this year, but it added a third dose of the vaccine to its trials to see if it is more effective.  The vaccines can't come soon enough for some parents. During the Omicron surge, the largest increase in hospitalization rates was among kids ages 4 and under, according to the CDC.Global pandemic death toll is three times higher than reported Covid-19 deaths suggest, study findsBut many more kids for whom vaccines are now authorized still need to get them. They are the age group with the lowest vaccination rate in the US. ""There still hasn't been nearly as much uptake as vaccines as we would want,"" said Dr. Shira Gertz, a pediatric critical care physician and researcher at Cooperman Barnabas Medical Center in New Jersey. ""Getting a vaccine is so much better than getting the disease.""The politics of it might be tricky, but schools could require that kids get vaccinated against Covid-19 before they return to class in the fall, like they do with other diseases. Only a handful of schools currently do, like those in Los Angeles, the District of Columbia and New Orleans, according to the Center on Reinventing Public Education. What's next for treatments and tests?There are 23 antivirals and 63 other treatments in late-stage clinical trials, according to Bio, a pharmacy industry association. Although Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine is authorized for people as young as 5, treatments for children remain limited. It's begun a Phase 2 and 3 clinical trial of its Covid-19 antiviral treatment, Paxlovid, in children ages 6 to 17. For treatments to work effectively, people have to get them quickly. The Biden administration's new test-to-treat program allows pharmacies with clinics to test someone for Covid-19 and immediately prescribe medication if they test positive. That program will play an even more vital role if cases surge again. What's next for masks?Hawaii is the last state in the country to end its indoor mask mandate. That ends March 25. On Thursday, the federal requirement that people wear masks on public transportation, including planes, was extended for another 30 days.People may be sick of them, and masks have become a hot political subject, but broader mask mandates could always come back if case numbers rise and hospitals fill up.Masking is hugely effective. Research from January 2021 that analyzed several studies of mask use in adults found that masks reduced the transmission of the virus significantly. And a National Institutes of Health study published Thursday found that during the Delta surge, schools with mandatory masking had 72% fewer cases of in-school transmission than those with mask-optional policies.""I think readers need to remember that even if we say 'this is what we're doing now,' we reserve the right to change stuff as needed,"" said Dr. Sharon Nachman, chief of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Stony Brook University in New York. Americans need to be flexible and adjust to the threat around them, she said.What about money for all these mitigation measures?Money to pay for the tests and treatments and vaccine research won't last forever, and more funding is not in the latest federal spending bill. The $15.6 billion earmarked for pandemic preparedness got stripped out. That was only half of what the Biden administration had asked for.The spending bill raises the CDC budget by $582 million, but it leaves out the pandemic waivers that gave schools extra federal funds to cope with Covid-19 outbreaks. The money that has bolstered many rural ""safety net"" hospitals expires soon. Safety net hospitals are those that, by legal obligation or mission, provide health care regardless of someone's ability to pay or insurance status. So more rural hospitals could close this year, and the US has already lost a record number of them during the pandemic. These business owners survived Covid. Now gas prices are surgingIt's a tenuous time. Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said  supplies of therapeutics, testing and vaccines are finally at a level where they meet demand. ""If there's issues with funding and any of those areas of progress start to fall off, we're going to be right back to the situation where we're playing catch-up and don't have enough,"" he said.On Wednesday, House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, introduced a standalone Covid supplemental bill to manage the pandemic at home and around the world, but it's unlikely to pass.What about the long-term consequences of Covid?Scientists continue to study people with long Covid to try to understand the condition's symptoms and treatments. As many as 30% who've tested positive for the virus may have long-term symptoms like fatigue, breathing trouble, joint and chest pain, and heart problems, studies show. Mental health has been an ongoing challenge for adults and kids during the pandemic. Four in 10 adults reported symptoms of anxiety or depression during the pandemic, up from 1 in 10 before the pandemic. In communities of color, mental health issues are disproportionately undertreated. For kids, the Biden administration's national mental health strategy, announced this month, will try to address some provider and program shortages to address their needs.More than 206,800 children in the US have lost their primary caregiver to Covid, and advocates are also pushing for programs to address their needs.Will this ever be over?People need to be flexible and not let down their guard too soon, the experts say. ""When places relax measures at the wrong moment, transmission spikes dangerously, and we lose more lives,"" Pan American Health Organization Director Dr. Carissa F. Etienne said Wednesday, urging countries to base decisions on risk assessments and health data and to tighten public health guidance if cases start to rise.The bottom line, Lang said: Covid is here to stay, but the pandemic part could be in our rearview mirror -- or at least move into a more manageable stage -- if people get vaccinated and boosted. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.""The Covid vaccine is much more effective in preventing deaths than the flu vaccine in preventing deaths,"" he said. ""So, you know, we really can combat this thing by people getting vaccinated and boosted.""Gertz also recommends that people pay attention to the numbers around them. ""We have to continue to be diligent and aware of what's going on in our immediate surroundings,"" she said. That doesn't mean people will be in masks forever, but they should wear them when necessary, and take prevention measures like washing their hands. ""Actually, we should always wash our hands."""

And anyone who got the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine should get a booster shot after two months, the CDC said.Some moderately or severely immunocompromised people who have had three doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna Covid-19 vaccines can already get a fourth dose of vaccine, according to the CDC.But it's not clear if or when the US Food and Drug Administration might authorize a fourth dose of Covid-19 vaccine for healthy teens and adults.

For many, that's the moment when we hope we can get back to our regular lives.   Several times during this pandemic, I have written essays about America as if the country was my patient. The current situation has me thinking along those lines again.  Doctors, like anyone else, love to give good news. We see the value of hope but also recognize that honesty must be our North Star. I would love to be the good guy here and tell my patient that it's time to be discharged from this chapter of our lives. But a doctor's job is to fully assess the situation and lean into the nuance, as opposed to simple axioms. Time for a physicalSo let's examine America, the patient. On the one hand, the numbers are going down. Cases of Covid-19 are more than a third lower this week than they were last week and the lowest they've been since July, according to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University.  And the number of people hospitalized is about a fifth of what it was during the country's mid-January peak. Even deaths, the so-called lagging indicator, have been falling; they're at their lowest point in two months. Read MoreAll 50 states are in the process of lifting restrictions. On March 26, Hawaii will become the last state to end its indoor mask mandate. Requiring masks in K-12 schools cut Covid-19 infections, study showsAt the federal level, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made big changes in late February. Instead of primarily using  levels of coronavirus transmission within a community as the key metric for determining mask guidance, the agency recommends that three data points be considered instead: new Covid-19 hospitalizations, hospital capacity and Covid-19 cases. So now, instead of a transmission map that paints most of the country an ""inflamed"" red, the community levels map shows a lot of cooler green and yellow, with a bit of orange -- the new low, medium and high categories. Since that change, there has been a big drop in the percentage of Americans living under masking recommendations, from 99% under the old metrics to just about 2% now.And at the start of the month, the White House unveiled its National Covid-19 Preparedness Plan. The new plan focuses on ""vaccines, treatments, tests, masks,"" White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said. ""These tools are how we continue to protect people and enable us to move forward safely and get back to our more normal routines.""As part of that, government testing and treatment initiatives are being streamlined and made more widely available. A closer lookBut in medicine, we cannot rely on lab results and a medical history. We need to perform a thorough and detailed exam. And when we do that, a more complete picture of the patient emerges.  First on CNN: Biden administration set to extend travel mask mandate for another monthTruth is, America, my patient still has an active infection. Although the numbers are falling, they are still painfully high: The country is averaging just under 37,000 new cases of Covid-19 a day. It's as if saying the patient used to have a very high fever but now only has a moderately high fever. The point is, it's still too high. We wouldn't stop treating the patient's infection at this point but rather complete the course of treatment and care.There's also the issue of understanding the effects the illness may have on my patient in the future. In this case, it means acknowledging an entirely new disease: long Covid. Many Americans are enduring the lingering effects of a past infection, battling health conditions like fatigue, brain fog, shortness of breath, cardiac issues. The list of long Covid symptoms is lengthy and varied; there are no answers as to who and why, nor are there easy, one-size-fits-all treatments. We are in the early days of this disease, but I was particularly struck by the recent paper indicating a previous Covid infection being a significant risk factor for future heart problems.And, even more important, there are still about 30,000 Americans hospitalized for Covid and, on average, more than 1,250 deaths a day. That's the equivalent of about two jumbo jets dropping out of the sky every day. My patient still needs lots of care.Other factors at playDespite the less red and inflamed transmission map, it still shows there's a lot of virus out there. If the virus came in the form of a raindrop, parts of our country would still be getting drenched. I have often imagined how different things would be if we could have actually seen the virus -- little green particles circulating around people's noses and mouths and becoming airborne. What if we had been able to witness its destruction and journey into blood vessels and lungs? This invisible enemy circumvented our basic human ability to detect a threat and, as a result, made us more likely to ignore and even deny it. Covid-19 safety tips to consider as you return to workI would remind my patient we have been here before. We experienced moments of genuine hope earlier and then witnessed how quickly things can change. In the summer of 2021, the Delta variant surprised us, and in December, Omicron blindsided us. Both times, the spikes caused by these variants followed declarations of victory heralding the end of the pandemic. Currently, there is a subvariant of Omicron called BA.2 that may spread even faster than Omicron itself. According to the latest figures from the CDC, it now makes up about 11.6% of Covid cases in the US; the week before, 6.6%. BA.2 is the dominant variant in Denmark, the United Kingdom, India, South Africa and more than a dozen other countries. According to the World Health Organization, studies estimate it is 30% more contagious than the original Omicron (BA.1).  And while studies suggest that BA.2 is not more likely to lead to hospitalization than BA.1, another patient that I've been keeping an eye on, the United Kingdom, is seeing cases and hospitalizations starting to trend up again after declining steadily since mid-January. Sometimes, doctors gain a lot of information from watching how other patients are faring.



Podcast: Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta


Again, I get it. I would love to look at these past two years in the rearview mirror as well, but we need to learn the lessons of this pandemic and apply that knowledge in real time. Today. Now.Delta and Omicron represent two cautionary tales in the span of a few months. It would be shortsighted to ignore that reality, believing it will never happen again.  A blend of science and judgment The International Epidemiology Association's Dictionary of Epidemiology defines a pandemic as ""an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people.""  Two years ago, when we made the decision to use the word pandemic on CNN, before the CDC or WHO, it was fairly straightforward -- fundamentally, it was an exercise in math and data analysis. My producers and I spent a lot of time looking at whiteboards where we kept tabs on the growing numbers and locations of Covid-19 cases. One day, I remember thinking, ""If this isn't the very definition of a pandemic, I don't know what is. So why is no one else calling it that?""  And so we did.JUST WATCHEDDr. Gupta: Here's why CNN is calling this a pandemic (2020)ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDr. Gupta: Here's why CNN is calling this a pandemic (2020) 04:40 Although the line was clear entering the pandemic, it will be much fuzzier as we approach endemicity.  A disease is considered endemic when it is a ""constant presence ... within a given geographic area or population group."" It would also be predictable in its rate of spread without causing the level of disruption it does in a pandemic. But what is considered disruptive may be very different in one country compared with another, even from one person to the next. Progressing into this next phase will be based on a blend of science and judgment. What the exam reveals So if America were my patient, the question I would be asking: Is it really time to downgrade the country's present-day condition from pandemic to endemic? It's analogous in some ways to deciding when to discharge my surgical patients to the general care floor from the intensive care unit. This season's flu vaccine seems to be a poor match, early CDC data shows, but it's been a mild flu seasonI make rounds in the intensive care unit, carefully reviewing each patient's chart -- full of lab results, metrics and data. And then I sit at the bedside, watching, examining and understanding how they really feel. Can they stand on their own, put a fork to their mouth and a comb through their hair? Are their basic bodily functions returning to normal, and can they get by independently? It is a judgment call. Two people can have the same vital signs but be in very different places.     If America were my patient, what would I see when I sit at its bedside? Beyond 1,300 people dying a day, I would make note that almost 60,000 people died of Covid-19 during the month of February alone. In other words, more people died of Covid-19 in one month than die of the flu during a bad year.   So the question ultimately is: What is too disruptive? What are we willing to tolerate? At what point do we as a society throw up our hands and say, ""We can't do any better than this,"" so let's call this level of sickness and death ""endemic,"" accept the numbers and move on with our lives? And of course, my patient, America, lives on a planet with lots of other patients, all part of an intricate ecosystem. We must realize that America's health is dependent on the health of all the other patients on the planet: When any one of us is at risk, we are all at risk. Finding a measure of peace and quiescence None of this is easy. It's why epidemiologist and author Dr. Larry Brilliant said that ""endemic"" is a terrible word.  ""Smallpox was 'endemic' when it killed somewhere between a third and half a billion people in the 20th century. Malaria is endemic, and it's killing millions. Tuberculosis is endemic. And HIV/AIDS was sort of thrown out of people's consciousness by just labeling it 'endemic,' "" he said. Brilliant, who is CEO of Pandefense Advisory and a senior adviser at the Skoll Foundation, was a key player on the WHO team that eradicated smallpox.     Coronavirus wastewater data, CDC guidelines can give mixed signals on whether to maskHe pointed out that the technical definition of ""endemic"" is a disease that is generating an expected number of cases, to the expected community and the expected time. ""And because [Covid-19] is a baby of a disease ... it's way too early to try to figure out what is endemicity. We have to wait for it to become a teenager and see how it behaves,"" he said.  Brilliant prefers the term ""quiescent."" ""We want this thing to be quiet,"" he said. He recalled that in the early days of 2020, he and other epidemiologists and public health experts speculated that the illness would come in waves.  ""A wave is a really good metaphor to think about this. Sometimes, the waves come in a bunch at a time, and sometimes there's not a wave for hours, even days. Some waves are too small to really be called waves. But every once in a while, there's a rogue wave, this tsunami.""  Here's how to get free antiviral medicine if you test positive for Covid-19He explained, ""what we want is the interval [between waves] to be long and the water in the waves to be quiescent. And that's what we're trying to say when people use the word 'endemic.' ... To say that the pandemic has gone endemic is failure -- it's not success. We haven't put it where we want it. So it's the wrong way of thinking about it."" Plus, said Brilliant, saying that the pandemic is over means ""we give up our duty of care.""He believes we still have a duty of care to the immunocompromised, the elderly, the vulnerable and, yes, even the unvaccinated, because they are the ones disproportionately dying.  Life with an endemic disease Humans are increasingly living side by side with pathogens that were once in the wild but then took hold among us. We might not like it, and sometimes the pathogen comes too close for comfort, but we learn to live with it.  Take the parasite malaria. For millennia, it killed off wide swaths of the global population. In fact, the mosquito, which transmits the parasite that causes disease, is one of the most prolific killers of humans worldwide. Global Covid-19 deaths surpass 6 millionInarguably, the course of humanity has been shaped by malaria: It's believed to have contributed to the fall of Rome, and for hundreds of years, it helped protect Africa from European colonization even as it infected the local population. (And it's why the gene for sickle cell anemia, which is protective against malaria, never died off evolutionarily.) In this country, Presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln grappled with it. The disease stunted the physical and economic growth of the rural South through the 1930s, and it is why the precursor to the CDC was founded.   It's an understatement to say man has been living with malaria for a very long time. And although we may not have eradicated it from the face of the Earth or completely tamed it, we have learned to coexist with it and reduced it to an endemic disease in a shrinking number of countries. The United States eradicated it in 1951.   How did we do that? By arming ourselves with knowledge. Through scientific research, we learned about where malaria comes from and how it is spread. We developed mitigation strategies and medications to blunt its impact.  And our work is still not done: In 2020, malaria killed an estimated 627,000 people, the vast majority of them children in sub-Saharan Africa.Early detection, rapid responseMany experts, including Brilliant, are pretty sure that Covid-19 is here to stay. Like the common cold (also often caused by a coronavirus) or the flu, it's expected to be part of our lives for the next 10, 50 or 100 years, and life will never be quite the same again. Burnout may be changing your brain. Here's what to do But we can improve the situation and learn to live with it. ""We want the disease to occur in places that we expect it, in the numbers that we expect, so we know how to deal with it,"" Brilliant said. ""You can go to Hawaii on vacation and not worry. Your kids can go to school. And you don't need to worry about going to dinner with your parents or your grandparents. Maybe it's quiet and you have to still wear masks. Maybe it's quiet and you still have to be tested before you go someplace. But it's not on the front page every day."" The key, said Brilliant, is two-part: early detection and rapid response.  For that to happen, we have to have good monitoring tools and be nimble going into and out of protective mode. Maybe that means we carry a mask in our coat pocket during wintertime, just like we take an umbrella when the forecast predicts rain; maybe we keep a box of rapid tests and a packet of antivirals in the bathroom cabinet for when we are under the weather; maybe we close a school but like we do with the flu -- with surgical precision, using a scalpel instead of a chainsaw.The good news, Brilliant said, is that moving forward, our tools -- vaccines, surveillance, tests, treatments, prophylactics -- will only get better. The inescapable fact is that we live in the era of pandemics. There are simply more and more opportunities for a pathogen, like the SARS-CoV-2 virus, to come in contact with the human population, make the jump and take hold. It's a dance we are increasingly doing because we are infringing more and more on the microbes' territory. Population growth, deforestation, climate change all contribute to this.

These pathogens are going to keep emerging in humans, but pandemics are not inevitable. Humans have evolved to create remarkable public health tools to prevent that, just as long we are smart and humane enough to use them.  My patient -- America -- is still in precarious health and will have to be careful moving forward to maintain all of the gains and continue making progress. Both the patient and doctors will have to remain vigilant and act quickly if there's any new infection. It's just not time for my patient to completely drop their guard, however much we would all like that to happen. We can and should be hopeful, but honesty must lead the way, full and transparent.

""It means a great deal to me to have Black folks tune in to 'The Gilded Age' and to feel represented,"" Erica Armstrong Dunbar, the show's historical consultant and one of its producers, told CNN. ""We're in a moment where we need to see dignity, where we need to reconcile with the violence and the trauma of segregation, of anti-Blackness, but also to see how these men and women who lived in the 19th century managed to live with that and still not be dehumanized by it.""The parallels between that long ago time period and the highly-charged conversations being had in the country at the moment about race are hard to ignore.The HBO series (HBO is owned by CNN's parent company) takes place initially in New York City in 1882, with the struggle between the ""old money"" families and the newly rich who want entry into the elite society at its center.Read MoreOne of the characters, Peggy Scott, played by Denée Benton, is a young Black woman who is an aspiring writer.Viewers soon learn she is the daughter of successful parents played by stage-winning actors Audra McDonald and John Douglas Thompson.Armstrong Dunbar said it makes sense to portray such a family in a show about wealth, especially given that the Black elite and middle class are often ""not considered when we're telling this kind of larger story about America and about Black America.""""I feel like the Scott's story is a really nice counterweight to the storylines of the (wealthy and White) Russells or the van Rhijn households,"" she said. ""And ultimately this is all about how people are attempting to find wealth, hold onto wealth and pass that wealth on to future generations.""The historian credits the show's director and executive producer Salli Richardson Whitfield (who is Black) and creator Julian Fellowes with wanting to portray the Scott family. Fellowes is well known as the creator of ""Downton Abbey"" and his and Richardson Whitfield's involvement was one of the things that inspired Baltimore Sun journalist John-John Williams IV to watch ""The Gilded Age.""""I like ['The Gilded Age'] better than 'Downton Abbey' actually,"" Williams said. ""They haven't just inserted a Black person in, like in traditional pop culture when you have the Black friend and they would have no story. They would just be on screen.""""[The character of Peggy Scott] actually has her own life and her own story and she exists independent of the white lead and I think that's really important,"" he added.

According to court minutes obtained by CNN affiliate WKMG, Ninth Judicial Circuit Judge Vincent Chiu granted the Saget family's petition for the permanent injuction.    The judge's decision came nearly a month after Saget's family filed a lawsuit to block the release of some records, citing privacy concerns, as CNN previously reported. ""The entire Saget family is grateful that the Judge granted their request for an injunction to preserve Bob's dignity, as well as their privacy rights, especially after suffering this unexpected and tragic loss. We are pleased this issue has been resolved, and the healing process can continue to move forward.  All of the prayers and well wishes continuously extended to the family are beyond appreciated,"" Saget family attorney Brian Bieber said in a statement to CNN.Saget, 65, was found dead in his hotel room in Orlando, Florida, in January. The Orange County Medical Examiner's Office determined that his death was accidental, most likely due to him falling backward and striking his head.Read MoreOn Monday, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN The Orange County, Fla., Sheriff's Department completed its investigation into Saget's death and issued a final report on the matter. The report's findings are consistent with the medical examiner's initial ruling that Saget's death was accidental in nature, according to the source, who is not authorized to speak publicly about the matterThe document is subject to the court order barring the release of any new information about the comedian's death""There are no surprises in the report,"" the source said.Saget's widow Kelly Rizzo and her three daughters last month filed a lawsuit against Orange County's sheriff and the medical examiner's office, requesting that some investigation records related to the death be exempt from being revealed publicly because of their graphic nature in how they portray the late actor.""In the process of these investigations, Defendants created records which include photographs, video recordings, audio recordings, statutorily protected autopsy information, and all other statutorily protected information,"" the lawsuit stated. ""Upon information and belief, some of these Records graphically depict Mr. Saget, his likeness or features, or parts of him, and were made by Defendants during Defendants' investigations.""The family argues in the lawsuit that the release of this information -- whether through a public records request or any other avenue -- would cause them to ""suffer irreparable harm in the form of extreme mental pain, anguish, and emotional distress.""CNN's Amy Simonson, Aya Elamroussi, Tina Burnside and Kate Conerlv contributed to this report."

The social media ire directed toward Campion over her speech for best director stemmed from one particular moment that came after she acknowledged the other nominees in the category, who were all men. ""The Power of the Dog"" helmer then said, ""Venus and Serena, you're such marvels. However, you don't play against the guys, like I have to.""In addition to being inaccurate (the tennis champions have faced off men), some perceived Campion's statement as being dismissive of two successful Black women's accomplishments. ""I made a thoughtless comment equating what I do in the film world with all that Serena Williams and Venus Williams have achieved. I did not intend to devalue these two legendary Black women and world class athletes,"" Campion said on Monday in a statement via her representative. ""The fact is the Williams sisters have, actually, squared off against men on the court (and off), and they have both raised the bar and opened doors for what is possible for women in this world. The last thing I would ever want to do is minimize remarkable women."" Read MoreCampion's speech -- which was for one of four awards her Oscar-nominated film earned on Sunday -- began on a positive note, with Campion acknowledging the many ""incredible"" women present in the audience, including the Williams sisters. ""What an honor to be in the room with you,"" she said, specifically addressing the pair, before asking them for tennis lessons.In her statement Monday, Campion reiterated her ""love"" for Venus and Serena Williams. ""Their accomplishments are titanic and inspiring. Serena and Venus, I apologize and completely celebrate you,"" she said. It has been an up and down few weeks for Campion, whose film is a strong contender for best picture at the Oscars later this month. Last week, actor Sam Elliott expressed harsh criticisms of ""The Power of the Dog"" in a podcast interview, blasting the Western's ""allusions of homosexuality."" The Netflix drama, however, found many defenders in the aftermath against the comments -- naturally, its director among them.""I'm sorry, he was being a little bit of a B-I-T-C-H. He's not a cowboy; he's an actor,"" Campion told Variety in response to Elliott's comments. ""The West is a mythic space and there's a lot of room on the range. I think it's a little bit sexist.""CNN's Hazel Tang contributed to this report."

Previously inducted artists who align more with other genres include The Supremes, Johnny Cash and Madonna. But it wasn't until 2007 that the hall of fame inducted its first rap group, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. Earlier this year, when announcing the newest slate of nominees, Chairman of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation John Sykes said the artists chosen each had ""a profound impact on the sound of youth culture.""The current criteria for inductees doesn't require them to record within the rock genre -- to be eligible, artists must have released their first commercial recording 25 years earlier.

While the pandemic is not over, The Best in Us is a series that highlights people whose pandemic stories exemplify the resilience of the human spirit. (CNN)Two years after his second project, the critically acclaimed ""Care For Me,"" rapper Saba was ready to release his third full-length album.It was early 2020. The songs had been mixed and mastered; the videos shot; the rollout planned.You can guess what happened next. Rumors of a ""novel coronavirus"" turned into a global pandemic -- the world withdrew. And that album, the one Saba had been so ready to release, no longer felt necessary. ""There was nothing wrong with that music,"" the 27-year-old told CNN. ""But being in isolation, and thinking and spending so much time with myself and my own thoughts, I was like, 'Actually there's enough of this.' I don't want to contribute to the noise. I want to be intentional.""But there was no blueprint for making art during a worldwide health crisis. Read MoreConstant news of record deaths while fearing for the health of loved ones was a unique stressor. Then there was the persistent racist violence against Black and Asian communities that not only didn't stop when the pandemic hit, it got worse. Still, artists persisted. In April, barely a month into the pandemic, indie folk act Thao & The Get Down Stay Down made a music video for their song ""Phenom"" completely over Zoom. Electropop artist Charli XCX made her album ""How I'm Feeling Now"" at home in quarantine, workshopping songs live on Instagram with fans. Members of Spillage Village, a hip-hop collective consisting of J.I.D, Earthgang, Mereba and others, rented a home together in Atlanta and spent months creating ""Spilligion"" in their de facto art commune.We had to depend less on the inspiration and more on the actual practice.""Saba describes how it felt to make music during the pandemicEventually, Saba made his own album in the pandemic, too: ""Few Good Things,"" which dropped last month, complete with an accompanying short film. But the realities of early quarantine made creativity elusive. In the past, you could get hit with sparks of inspiration just by being out and about, Saba said. When you're just sitting at home, it's harder -- you have to work to make the spark happen.""We had to depend less on the inspiration and more on the actual practice,"" he said. ""It's like going to the gym or something. You have to build a habit.""Saba puts the finishing touches on ""Few Good Things"" in Revival Studio in Los Angeles in June 2021.So he, like many people, took to Zoom. Alongside friends and collaborators (fellow musicians Joseph Chilliams, MFnMelo, Frsh Waters, Squeak and Daedae), Saba cultivated a virtual writing group with a challenge to write a full verse, 16 bars, in 16 minutes. Soon, the group grew to about 12 people. Sometimes, they would meet multiple times a week, always holding each other accountable. The creativity, then, flowed from their community.When Saba started working on the new album, those larger sessions evolved into smaller ones between him and his two longtime producers, Daedae and Daoud. Because of the pandemic, they couldn't just rent time in studios, like they could with previous projects. While recording 2018's ""Care For Me,"" for example, Saba and the others gathered in Oakland, California to work on the project and would spend weeks at a time in the studio. That wasn't possible anymore. Instead, they fed each other audio from their respective computers, miles apart, and built songs from scratch. There were some logistical issues, naturally -- the three-hour time difference between them made scheduling difficult, for example. But the distance also, quite tangibly, impacted the music.It's most notable on the song ""Fearmonger,"" one of the tracks the trio made completely over Zoom. One person created the melody while another created the rhythm, but when they first played the riffs over the computer, there was a lag on Saba's end. What he heard was completely different from what Daoud and Daedae heard.Unlike in the past, Daoud (left) and Daedae only got together with Saba three times for studio sessions when working on the album.Later, when they sent the instrument stem files to Saba for arranging, he was confused. At first, he thought it was wrong. That's when they realized the issue. Saba arranged the track based on how he originally heard it -- speeding up the tempo as a result and creating a more funk-driven sound, different from anything they'd done in the past. That's the version on the album.""Some things that happen in production or in song lyrics, some of it is random sometimes. Some of it is just based on a mood or a feeling,"" Saba said. ""So working without that as the center of creation is ... what we had to find out how to do while we were making these songs on Zoom.""Without the collaborative studio time, without concerts to connect with fans, Covid-19 forced many artists back to square one, Saba said. They had to look inward: What artist do you want to be? What songs do you like? What message do you want to send?The last two years have come with setbacks, of course. But it also pushed many artists to embrace being uncomfortable. It's easy to become stagnant, to become complacent, in your art. By forcing that discomfort, Covid-19 cultivated a new sense of exploration -- and that's where the best art comes from, Saba said. In that sense, the pandemic hasn't just been about finding new ways to be creative. For artists like Saba, it has reshaped their relationship with creativity altogether."

Having spiraled from a particularly embarrassing encounter the night before, she's woken up to find that she's turned into a giant red panda.Mei's mother Ming assumes this reluctance to leave the bathroom means her 13-year-old daughter has just gotten her first period.""Did the ... did the red peony bloom?"" her mom asks through the door.Ming soon storms in with ibuprofen, vitamins, a hot water bottle and pads. Mei, unable to tell her mother what's really going on, endures an uncomfortable conversation about how she's now a woman and how her body is starting to change.Mei Lee is a 13-year-old girl who loves karaoke, her best friends and the boy band 4*Town. Mei is indeed undergoing a bodily transformation -- just not the one her mom thinks. As Mei soon discovers, she poofs into a furry red panda when she's overcome with emotion, reverting back only when she gets her emotions under control. Menstruation may not be what's ailing Mei, but the metaphor for periods, puberty and the ensuing emotional roller coaster is clear.Read MoreBy normalizing -- and even celebrating -- one of life's most awkward phases, ""Turning Red"" does something not often seen on film and television, especially media aimed at kids. It treats periods and female puberty as something to be embraced, rather than be embarrassed about.'Turning Red' normalizes periodsThough periods are an experience shared by half the world's population for a significant part of their lives, they're often regarded onscreen (when they're regarded at all) with fear, shame or disgust. It's a taboo that director Domee Shi was acutely aware of.""You don't see that very often in movies and TV shows,"" Shi said in an interview with entertainment news site Uproxx, of the period talk between Mei and her mom. ""And I think that's precisely why we wanted to put it in the movie. I mean, this movie is actually is for 13-year-old Domee that was in a bathroom, horrified, thinking that she had crapped her pants. And too afraid to tell her mom or ask anybody about what was going on.""Mei's complicated relationship with her mother is at the heart of ""Turning Red.""While positive period portrayals in kids' and family-oriented movies and TV shows are rare, there are some notable examples. In a 1990 episode of ""The Cosby Show,"" in which Rudy gets her first period, the youngest Huxtable rebuffs her mom Clair Huxtable's efforts to celebrate the occasion and turns to her friends for support. When the information she gets from her pals is faulty, it's Clair who steps in to reassure her that periods are completely normal.There was the 1991 episode of the sitcom ""Blossom,"" which saw its titular character struggling to talk to her dad about her first period and wishing she had Clair Huxtable to guide her. A scene from the 1991 coming-of-age film ""My Girl"" features Vada screaming that she's hemorrhaging, only to be told that she's gotten her period. A 2001 episode of the animated series ""Braceface"" sees Sharon mistake her menstrual cramps for appendicitis. And in more recent history, the ABC sitcom ""Black-ish"" treats Diane's first period as an empowering experience.Still, these examples tend to be the exception, not the norm. Tackling the subject of periods feels especially radical for an animation giant like Pixar, given that 20 of the 24 films released by the studio center males. But by addressing menstruation with candor and levity, the creators of ""Turning Red"" intend to destigmatize it -- for everyone, not just young girls.""The hope is with putting it on the screen and having it be something that is cringy, but also funny, and a part of this story, it does normalize it,"" producer Lindsey Collins told pop culture and gaming news site Polygon. ""There's an appreciation from anybody who's gone through it for what we put on the screen, but also those who haven't gone through it.""It also embraces the emotional extremes of pubertyBeyond periods, ""Turning Red"" explores puberty in all its uncomfortable glory -- through the eyes of a confident, goofy Chinese Canadian girl. In the words of Shi, it's an ""Asian tween fever dream.""Throughout the film, Mei navigates the awkwardness, excitement and embarrassment that come with changing hormone levels and manifest in her body as a red panda. She grapples with lust and attraction, crushing on the teenage convenience store cashier and members of her favorite boy band 4*Town alike. She imagines her objects of desire as mermen, then berates herself for doing so when her drawings are found out. She longs to see 4*Town in concert with her best friends, and vents to them angrily when her mom says no.""From the very beginning, [I was] just really trying to not hold back with telling the story about a girl going through puberty. We're going to go there,"" Shi said in an interview with IndieWire. ""From the very first version, it had pads, it had puberty, it had the weird boy crushes and drawings.""Mei is just like any other girl navigating puberty -- except for the turning into a panda part.But perhaps the most profound challenge for Mei during this period of her life is figuring out how to be herself while also respecting the wishes of her parents -- a coming-of-age dilemma surely familiar to many children of immigrants. As Mei discovers more about who she is, she finds that parts of herself conflict with the image her mother has of her. Learning to accept those parts of herself, while finding the courage to stand up to her mother, is part of Mei's pubescent transformation, too.Shi has said she hopes that ""Turning Red"" helps girls and women feel seen -- and that it signals that periods, puberty and unwieldy emotions are simply a normal part of life."

That's probably enough for Netflix coming off a success with Reynolds in ""Red Notice,"" but like the film's plot, this amounts to rehashing history.Reynolds neatly sums up ""The Adam Project's"" modest ambitions in the production notes, saying that the concept ""ticked every box for us."" That means giving the star a chance to be heroic and funny, while adding a dollop of heart that borders a bit too much on sappiness.The producers were equally shrewd in the casting, having Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo playing the Reynolds character's parents, serving up a bonus reunion of the 2004 rom-com ""13 Going on 30.""That said, the central relationship is actually between Reynolds' Adam and his 12-year-old self, played by Walker Scobell.Having lost his dad, the young Adam is warned by his mom that ""The future is coming sooner than you think,"" but that can't possibly prepare him for what happens next: The elder Adam blasts into our time from 2050, employing time-travel technology to try stopping a villain (Catherine Keener) by altering the past in order to change the future.Read MoreThe kid not surprisingly has several million questions, and seems amusingly pleased that his scrawny, bullied self has grown up to be an accomplished pilot who's resourceful in a fight and not incidentally pretty ripped. (Reynolds, of course, played a pilot in ""Green Lantern"" before another superhero, ""Deadpool,"" firmly established his current brand.)""We've seen 'Terminator,' right?"" the older version asks the younger one, capturing the general irreverence toward the science-fiction underpinnings of the enterprise, which rather unabashedly approaches the time-travel aspect as a fertile comedic device and an opportunity to explore heart-tugging moments regarding family and words left unspoken.The back-from-the-future premise also includes a subplot involving Adam's lost wife (Zoe Saldaña, adding another Marvel veteran in a smallish role) and leads to some inordinately bad computer-generated de-aging graphics, the kind of shortcoming that's mildly distracting but easily ignored.Indeed, the underlying strength of ""The Adam Project"" is that it keeps serving notice not to overthink things, but rather to sit back and enjoy Reynolds' banter with his younger self as well as the colorful action.It's passable on those terms, but not much more than that, reflecting the pitfalls of Netflix's current movie strategy, which beyond a handful of prestige awards-seeking titles seemingly consists of attracting big promotable stars and volume, volume, volume.""The Adam Project"" recalls the past in cinematic terms by feeling conspicuously like what used to be dubbed a ""B"" movie, a genre that no longer has much traction in theaters. The modern twist on that is you needn't leave home, or directly pay extra, to consume its simple formula, stacked a rather rickety foundation of ticked-off boxes.""The Adam Project"" premieres March 11 on Netflix."

The question is whether Smollett will clear the invisible bar set for him to make his way back onto screens big and small or end up on a list of uncastable actors. There are indications that at least some notable figures in Hollywood have not distanced himself from Smollett, who got his start in the industry at 12 years old in a short-lived ABC's sitcom in which he starred alongside his siblings. At a hearing on Thursday, at which Smollett was sentenced to 150 days in jail, Smollett's team presented the judge with letters of support from actor Samuel L. Jackson and his wife LaTanya, among others. Read MoreIn their letter, the couple argued that Smollett should be spared jail time and that the 39-year-old ""has already suffered a great deal of punishment as this situation has destroyed his existing career and impuned his reputation."" Smollett's sister, Jurnee Smollett, arguably the most acclaimed of the family's six entertainer siblings, remains well connected and regarded in the industry, as well. Even as the family navigated Jussie Smollett's legal troubles, she was among the cast of HBO's horror drama ""Lovecraft Country,"" which debuted in 2020. (CNN, like HBO, is owned by WarnerMedia.) It was on the press tour for that series that the actress, known for her past roles on shows like WGN's ""Underground"" and HBO's ""True Blood,"" publicly opened up about her brother's scandal in detail and reiterated her support for him.Smollett was found guilty back in December on five counts of felony disorderly conduct for making false reports about what he said was an anti-gay and anti-Black hate crime. The actor, who is Black and gay, told Chicago police that in January 2019, two unknown men attacked him, yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him, poured bleach on him and wrapped a noose around his neck.Chicago police investigated the case as a possible hate crime and at the time, celebrities and politicians rushed to defend him publicly.  That support wavered as the incident's twists and turns played out, particularly as investigators soon determined the actor orchestrated the incident and paid two brothers he knew from the Fox drama ""Empire"" to stage the incident for publicity.On Thursday, the silence from some of Smollett's original defenders was deafening.Actress Yvette Nicole Brown was an exception. Among those who expressed her ""love"" for the Smollett family in 2019, Brown shared her thoughts once again on Friday, tweeting, ""The way that judge reprimanded Jussie, you'd think he murdered 2 people or used a gun instead of a taser on a Black man at a traffic stop."" Smollett's attorneys have indicated they intend to appeal.CNN's Jason Kravarik and Brad Parks contributed to this report."

Three things to watch'The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey'Read More(From left) Dominique Fishback and Samuel L. Jackson are shown in ""The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey.""I am a huge fan of the writer Walter Mosley and have read just about all of his novels.Which is why I was super excited to learn that a limited series based on one of my favorites, ""The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,"" was coming to Apple TV+.Samuel L. Jackson plays the title character, a man with dementia who has his memory restored long enough to try and solve the mysterious death of a loved one. Dominique Fishback (who was tremendous in ""Judas and the Black Messiah"") plays his caregiver.It's currently streaming.'The Adam Project' (From left) Ryan Reynolds as Big Adam and Walker Scobell as Young Adam star in ""The Adam Project.""Ordinarily sci-fi is not my jam, but sign me up for any and everything involving Ryan Reynolds.I am such a huge admirer of his ... acting. In ""The Adam Project,"" Reynolds teams up again with ""Free Guy"" director Shawn Levy for a story about a boy grappling with loss who meets his future self, a time-traveling pilot searching for his wife (played by Zoe Saldana).The movie is now streaming on Netflix.'The Thing About Pam' (From left) Mac Brandt as Detective McCarrick and Glenn Fleshler as Russ Faria star in ""The Thing About Pam."" Renée Zellweger is getting a lot of attention for donning prosthetics to play Pam Hupp in this limited series, based on a ""Dateline NBC"" story about a woman accused of allegedly killing her best friend, Betsy Faria. But pay attention to the whole cast in this one.For starters, there's Glenn Fleshler as Betsy's husband, Russ Faria, who is, of course, the initial prime suspect and Josh Duhamel as his attorney, Joel Schwartz. And the whole thing feels a bit over the top.The best true crime stories usually are, and this one was not only a ""Dateline"" episode but also a podcast. ""The Thing About Pam"" is airing on NBC.Two things to listen to (From left) Luke Smallbone and Joel Smallbone of For King & Country attend the 52nd GMA Dove Awards at Lipscomb Allen Arena on October 19, 2021, in Nashville, Tennessee. Hey, fans of For King & Country, ""What Are You Waiting For?""That's the title of the duo's first new album in three years. Grammy-winning brothers Joel and Luke Smallbone fought hard to get here.""Those first years when we started working together in the late 2000s, those first years we just got turned down,"" Joel Smallborne told American Songwriter. ""By every major label in America.""They kept the faith (literally, as they credit their success to it) and now the Christian pop artists are enjoying the fruits of their labor.The album dropped Friday. Lil Durk performs at the runway show for PrettyLittleThing x Teyana Taylor at New York Fashion Week on September 9, 2021. Lil Durk's ""7220"" was originally scheduled to drop the same day as Ye's ""Donda 2"" before Lil Durk pushed back the release. To make it even more interesting, the rapper took to his verified Instagram account to dare any other artist to drop their album on the same day.He didn't name anyone in particular, but Lil Durk and NBA YoungBoy have been beefing recently, in case you didn't know.""7220"" dropped Friday. 
One thing to talk about(From left) Russell Wilson and Ciara, cofounders of The House of LR&C, celebrate the brand's first retail launch on February 22 in Seattle's University Village. There may have been lots of talk this week about professional quarterback Russell Wilson getting traded, but that's not all that's going on in his world.Wilson and his wife, singer and actor Ciara, also have a new children's book out.The parents of three young children have cowritten a picture book, titled ""Why Not You?""They recently shared with Jimmy Kimmel on his late night show that Wilson's dad used to often say that phrase and that Ciara's parents also instilled in her that ""no dream is too big.""""We share that same passion and connection,"" she told Kimmel.Love that kind of love.Something to sip on A woman passes by Brazilian artist Sipros' mural of the rapper Biggie Smalls, featured on a wall in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, New York, on June 6, 2019.For those of us who remember, it hardly seems possible that it's been 25 years since Biggie Smalls, aka Notorious B.I.G., was gunned down in Los Angeles. The rapper, born Christopher Wallace, was killed when his vehicle came under fire as he and his entourage left an industry party.It feels like only yesterday that I was writing about the 20th anniversary of his death on March 9, 1997.Wallace's murder has never been solved, but his musical influence remains. As is often the case with those who die young, his mythology has grown over the years even as many wonder where both he and his career would be now had he lived.Hip-hop has aged well — as was displayed at this year's Super Bowl — but count me as one who wishes that both Wallace and Tupac Shakur, who was gunned down six months before Biggie, had lived to see it.

At roughly $7 a month, that's a whole lot of credits, and ""Star Wars"" shows, like ""The Mandalorian,"" are obviously a major part of that.Read MoreStill, Disney is in the theatrical business as well, where hits have become increasingly elusive, a trend that preceded the pandemic but that has been significantly exacerbated by it. Increasingly, there appears to be a very narrow tier of blockbusters -- ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" and ""The Batman"" among the recent examples -- that can overcome the gravitational pull of streaming's tractor beam. For everything else, it's wait until Netflix or one of its competitors offers it.Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi in the upcoming Disney+ series.An Obi-Wan Kenobi movie, starring McGregor, would seem to have the combination of elements to clear that hurdle. Instead, the studio opted to go the Disney+ route after the disappointing box-office performance by ""Solo,"" a 2018 prequel that cast Alden Ehrenreich in the title role.At the time, Collider reported that Disney and Lucasfilm had decided to put all the ""Star Wars"" spinoff movies ""on hold"" because of ""Solo's"" commercial misfire, which prompted headlines like ""'Solo' Is Officially the First 'Star Wars' Movie to Flop."" That included what was then planned to be an Obi-Wan feature.""I just think that we might've put a little bit too much in the marketplace too fast,"" Disney's then-CEO, Bob Iger, told the New York Times.Saturating the market was likely a factor. Arguably, though, the studio might have overreacted, in the process underestimating the appeal of the Kenobi character and the lure of having McGregor (as opposed to a recast newcomer) reprise the role.While it's fun to speculate and play ""What if?,"" it will be virtually impossible to sort out whether Disney left money on the outer rim by producing a limited series instead of a movie. People sign up and maintain streaming subscriptions for all sorts of content, although it seems fair to surmise that ""Star Wars"" fans won't cancel Disney+ any time before ""Kenobi"" finishes its run.The series, incidentally, premieres on May 25, which happens to be the 45th anniversary of the Jedi knight's debut in ""Star Wars,"" back in the day before chapter subheads were involved, when people's at-home alternatives were mostly limited to the three broadcast networks.Would a Kenobi movie, released on that anniversary with the kind of trailer that just broke the internet, bring people out to theaters today? Let's just say that if Disney had stuck to its original plans, even with all that's happened to movie-going, they'd be justified in having a good feeling about this."

In it, Baldwin claims that he asked Hutchins if he should cock the gun and that she told him to do it.""Baldwin asked Hutchins whether she wanted to see him cock the gun, as the script required. She responded yes. Baldwin tipped the gun down somewhat so that the lens of the camera would be able to focus on his hand's action on the top of the gun. While performing this action, Baldwin asked Hutchins, 'Am I holding it too far down?' and 'Do you see that?' Hutchins responded that she could see Baldwin's action from her angle. Baldwin then pulled back the hammer, but not far enough to actually cock the gun. When Baldwin let go of the hammer, the gun went off,"" the filing says.Attorneys for Hutchins' family told CNN in a statement:""Alec Baldwin once again is trying to avoid liability and accountability for his reckless actions before and on Oct 21st that resulted in the death of Halyna Hutchins, as demonstrated by today's arbitration demand for indemnification from the Rust production company.  Baldwin's disclosure of personal texts with Matt Hutchins is irrelevant to his demand for arbitration and fails to demonstrate anything other than Hutchins' dignity in his engagement with Baldwin.  It is shameful that Baldwin claims Hutchins' actions in filing a wrongful death lawsuit derailed the completion of ""Rust."" The only action that ended the film's production was Baldwin's killing of Halyna Hutchins.""Read MoreThe court documents also claim that when Baldwin arrived on the New Mexico set, he underwent a training session with the film's armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed and that he understood from that session that he did not need to check the gun for live ammunition. ""Reed did not instruct Baldwin to check the gun himself. In fact, she told Baldwin that it was her job to check the gun—not his,"" the documents read. ""Similarly, Baldwin believed, based on prior gun safety training he received on movie sets, that actors should not unilaterally check guns for live ammunition. If actors want to check a gun for their own peace of mind, they should only check the gun with the armorer closely supervising the process. In other words, actors may jointly inspect a gun with the armorer, but never on their own.""CNN has reached out to representatives for Guiterrez Reed.The legal filing Friday also includes numerous text messages between Baldwin and Matthew Hutchins following the shooting, up until Baldwin's ABC interview. Two weeks following his sit-down, Baldwin's final text to Hutchins was to wish his son a happy birthday.""Since October 21, Baldwin had offered comfort and support to Matthew Hutchins and his son, as well as constructive input towards a settlement of the case,"" Baldwin's arbitration filing states. ""He has worked extensively to find ways to help Hutchins and his son. It is that same spirit that renders Baldwin reluctant to contradict some of Matthew Hutchins's public statements. Unfortunately, given the nature of Hutchins's accusations against Baldwin, he has no choice.""CNN a representative for Rust Movie Productions LLC."

That's a fitting metaphor for the character's much-debated history in movies, which has cast an unusually large shadow thanks to fans convinced, in their minds, precisely how the Dark Knight should be depicted.Created in 1939, Batman isn't the first superhero or even necessarily the best. But different approaches to adapting him for the screen have provoked inordinate passion among fans, including knee-jerk reactions that border on the hysterical. That included the howls that greeted casting Michael Keaton in the 1980s (admittedly an unorthodox choice) and perhaps especially Ben Affleck in 2013.In a December interview with Howard Stern, Affleck admitted feeling ""hurt"" by an online petition that circulated opposing him starring in ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice."" For his part, Stern pointed out that Batman aficionados have a track record of complaining ""no matter who gets that role.""Through the years, fans seeking fidelity to the comics have had reason to be wary and suspicious of Hollywood.The key window for Batman in comics came in the 1970s, which marked shift from the lightness and camp that characterized the 1960s ""Batman"" TV show -- with its ""Wap! Bam! Pow!"" graphics -- to a darker vision of the caped vigilante.Read More""The Batman,"" starring Robert Pattinson, represents the latest screen incarnation of the character, and in many ways feels designed to tap into the desires of that ardent fan base. Brooding and serious, the film caters to those weaned on Batman as a creature of the night, an image honed by comic-book artists Marshall Rogers and Neal Adams in the '70s, and Frank Miller in the landmark graphic novel ""The Dark Knight Returns.""Director/co-writer Matt Reeves has cited another comic written by Miller, ""Batman: Year One,"" which captures an early stage in his crimefighting career, among his inspirations.Ben Affleck as Batman in 'Zack Snyder's Justice League.'Those comics evolved Batman's profile toward a more adult tone that informed director Tim Burton's 1989 movie. Yet even with its success, sequels directed by the late Joel Schumacher -- starring Val Kilmer, and then George Clooney -- revived the kind of broader camp that many comics fans saw as the bad old days.Christopher Nolan rectified that with his trilogy of ""Batman Begins,"" ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" which featured Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning take on the Joker -- the kind of prestige that usually eludes superhero fare.But reinvention has always been a part of Batman's screen incarnations. Toby Emmerich, chairman of the Warner Bros. Picture Group (like CNN, part of WarnerMedia), recently told the New York Times that Reeves' challenge was to ""create a Batman that is compelling and dynamic and thrilling, but different than anything we've seen before.""While the movie is assured of a big opening weekend, how well it lasts will be determined not just by how committed fans respond, but whether those less invested join them in marching back to theaters.When Affleck was selected, CNN's Jake Tapper jokingly introduced a segment on the overheated response as ""the debate tearing this country apart: Batfleck."" The next year, Affleck conceded to Entertainment Weekly that Warner Bros. warned him about possible blowback, quoting studio brass as saying, ""Are you sure you want to get into this? This is part and parcel of these movies now. There's a lot of active fans with a lot of opinions."" Social media has fueled that dynamic, creating echo chambers where those holding ""a lot of opinions"" can commiserate with like-minded souls, or conversely, argue with dissenters.The loudest voices, of course, aren't always the most representative, especially with something like Batman. But they do reflect why that Bat-signal occupies such a distinctive place in pop culture: Because so many people think they know what's right for the character, believing that he -- no matter who wears the costume -- belongs to them."

Audiences should still warm to this mother-daughter story on streaming, but in bypassing theaters it feels like the studio is leaving some green on the table.Directed and co-written by Domee Shi (the theatrical short ""Bao""), the film tells the story of 13-year-old Mei Lee (voiced by Rosalie Chiang), whose family runs a Chinese temple in Toronto. An honor student who craves the approval of her mother (Sandra Oh), Mei has a trio of close friends with whom she shares a passion for a boy group named 4*town, which will soon be playing a concert in her town.Budding boy mania, however, triggers another unexpected response: Mei's transformation into a furry Red Panda, a legacy of her family's mystical history. The parallels between that and the advent of puberty are unavoidable, and Shi and co-writer Julie Cho hilariously lean into them, with Mei's introduction to dawning womanhood bringing with it a series of mortifying side effects.In tone and style, ""Turning Red"" perhaps most closely resembles ""Inside Out,"" another Pixar film that did an inordinately good job of addressing the pangs of this particular age in a sprightly and entertaining package. Here, the add-ons include not only a generational clash but the weight of expectations that Mei faces, trying to satisfy her mother as she begins to exhibit signs of independence.""Turning Red"" also gets a whole lot of mileage out of the panda gags, which, in the crassest commercial terms, should sell a whole lot of plush toys to younger tykes.Read MoreLike the best Pixar fare, the film operates on multiple levels, in ways that will be relatable to parents and older kids that are both culturally specific and broadly universal, with the added garnish of original songs by Billie Eilish.Animation has obviously been a major driver for Disney+ over the past two years, at a time when the streaming service needed content and viewers were hungry for escapes at home.Whether that logic holds as theaters are opening up is between Pixar and Disney's accounting teams, but the lack of a theatrical window right now is puzzling, with a movie that's qualitatively in the conversation with the Oscar-winning ""Soul,"" and a cut above recent releases ""Luca"" and ""Onward.""Still, wherever one sees it, ""Turning Red"" delivers an exquisitely animated story that's moving as well as funny -- welcome evidence that creatively speaking, at least, Pixar hasn't lost its golden touch.""Turning Red"" premieres March 11 on Disney+."

Although '80s-style excess clearly accounts for much of the sizzle, this exercise feels like a no-look pass that skips out of bounds.Produced by ""Don't Look Up's"" Adam McKay (who also directed the first episode), and based on Jeff Pearlman's book about the period, the 10-episode series focuses on the first season in which new owner Jerry Buss (John C. Reilly) drafted rookie phenom Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson (standout newcomer Quincy Isaiah), winning the first of five NBA titles in a decade.In addition to their passion for basketball, the late Buss and Johnson (who has notably disavowed the project) shared a playboy lifestyle, while transforming the Forum, where the Lakers played their games, into the hottest ticket in town.What came to be known as the ""Showtime"" Lakers (a title left unused by HBO for obvious reasons) featured a larger-than-life collection of personalities, and a series of soap-opera-worthy twists, like coach Jerry West (Jason Clarke) quitting, but still hanging around; and new coach Jack McKinney (Tracy Letts) suffering a devastating accident that left overwhelmed assistant Paul Westhead (Jason Segel) in charge.Still, ""Winning Time"" feels too cute for its own good, especially in the early going, when characters keep breaking the fourth wall to chat directly with the audience, and everyone but Buss and Magic appears to be kind of a jerk.Read MoreTo be fair, the series settles down a bit after that (eight of the 10 episodes were previewed), focusing on fleshing out individual players, from Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (Solomon Hughes, a mere 6'11"") to Buss' daughter Jeanie (Hadley Robinson), treated abysmally by her direct bosses because she's the owner's kid.John C. Reilly as Dr. Jerry Buss in 'Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty.'There are some memorable moments scattered along the way, such as Buss' encounter with Boston Celtics president Red Auerbach (Michael Chiklis), who sizes up the real-estate mogul as a dilettante and dismisses him as any threat to the Celtics' aspirations. Reilly also makes the most of Buss' flamboyance, spending almost drunkenly as he hangs off the edge of a financial cliff and assures everyone who asks, ""Let me worry about the money.""For those wondering, most of the actors are roughly six inches shorter than their real-life counterparts, but the basketball sequences -- and the clever washed-out tones used in shooting the entire production -- work quite well. Isaiah captures Johnson's charisma and infectious enthusiasm, but also his competitive streak, particularly given the attention showered on fellow rookie superstar Larry Bird (Sean Patrick Small), the league's ""great White hope.""Yet despite its all-star lineup, which includes Sally Field as Buss' mother and Adrien Brody as future coach Pat Riley, ""Winning Time"" plays too fast and loose -- approaching its material with an irreverence, from snippets of animation to cheeky on-screen chyrons, in a way that's periodically off-putting. What should be catnip to those who watched ESPN's docuseries ""The Last Dance"" misses that target, winding up in a creative no-man's land.Buss does emerge as a visionary, someone who recognized the NBA's potential and Johnson's magnetism not just to win titles, and thanks to the rivalry with the Celtics, elevating the entire league's fortunes.It's a high-stakes, fact-based story that requires scant embellishment, one that could do for sports what ""Succession"" does for media.That blue-chip roster, however, only makes ""Winning Time's"" shortcomings more glaring. While the Lakers rose to the occasion, the series falls short of its potential in terms of conjuring premium-TV magic.""Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty"" premieres March 6 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of WarnerMedia.Correction: An earlier version of this story identified Red Auerbach as the owner of the Boston Celtics. During the period covered in the show he was the general manager, not the owner."

Drawing upon personal recordings and home videos, director Amy Poehler has served up a warm valentine that leans into celebrating their lives and away from the tabloid fodder.The documentary obviously serves as a sort of irresistible and logical companion to writer-director Aaron Sorkin's recent Amazon movie ""Being the Ricardos,"" although in ways it's even more nostalgic and sentimental. In terms of Arnaz's serial infidelity, for example, it's basically left to their daughter, Lucie Arnaz Luckinbill, to note that her parents hurt each other -- him with his actions, and her with words.What ""Lucy and Desi"" achieves most effectively is to capture the respective genius that the two brought not just to their show -- which originated the multicamera sitcom format -- but as producers more broadly. Detailing their respective backgrounds, it also presents their parallel rises to stardom before meeting on the RKO musical ""Too Many Girls,"" with Arnaz recalling seeing Ball and thinking, ""Oh man, that's a hunk of woman.""Like many a show-business romance, their whirlwind courtship and marriage flamed brightly and fizzled, with each lasting much longer with their second spouses than they did with each other.""To the rest of the world a Hollywood couple has no problems,"" Ball says.

Arnaz reminisces about his excesses by citing regret about a lack of moderation, saying, ""I either worked too hard or I played too hard."" Network executives, meanwhile, were nervous at first about how audiences would respond to seeing the Latin Arnaz as Lucy's husband, and later (as covered in the recent movie) by Ball's connection to the Red Scare.Nevertheless, Poehler and writer Mark Monroe tend to accentuate the positive, incorporating truly stirring moments that even most fans of the show might not have seen or recall. There's Ball's Emmy acceptance speech for ""The Lucy Show"" in 1967 (11 years after her second win for ""I Love Lucy""), her teary-eyed tribute at the Kennedy Center, and Arnaz Luckinbill recounting Lucy and Desi's final conversation shortly before her dad's death.Ultimately, it's an uplifting story of truly self-made talents who found each other, clawed their way to the top and helped birth something that, as the recent flurry of activity surrounding the show suggests, has survived them by decades.Arnaz is said to have chafed at Ball's fame at the time, but their mutual admiration comes through loud and clear. And while their marriage didn't endure, watching the clips roll by merely underscores that ""I Love Lucy"" is forever.""Lucy and Desi"" premieres March 4 on Amazon."

Yet it seems undeniable that hit films broadly help, giving potential viewers more of a rooting interest in who and what wins.Mindful of that, the Academy flirted with introducing a ""popular film"" category in 2018, seeking to add a more populist streak to the ceremony. After members shot down the idea for various (mostly logical) reasons, the organization opted to expand the best picture category to 10 movies, in part hoping that at least a few widely seen titles would sneak into the mix.Smaller movies, however, have generally prevailed. And part of the challenge that the Oscars and the movie business face has stemmed from the consumer pivot to streaming, a trend that was already growing before being dramatically hastened by the global pandemic.Hidetoshi Nishijima and Tôko Miura in 'Drive My Car,' which received Oscar nominations for best picture and international film.For theaters worried about their future, the fact that people interested in catching up on nominees will find ""The Power of the Dog"" (this year's most-nominated title, with 12) and ""Don't Look Up"" on Netflix -- along with others that earned major nominations, including ""Tick, Tick ... Boom!"" and ""The Lost Daughter"" -- won't ease those concerns.Because streamers generally don't provide detailed viewing data, it's unclear how many people have seen some of these movies, but they're obviously being watched via those platforms in vast numbers. Witness the Billboard-topping songs from ""Encanto,"" a nominee for best animated movie, which took off once that title landed on Disney+.While blockbusters (other than the sci-fi epic ""Dune,"" a more modest box-office performer) remain scarce in the best-picture category, the Academy did recognize an international movie, Japan's critical darling ""Drive My Car,"" as well as its director, Ryusuke Hamaguchi. That follows the historic best-picture win by ""Parasite"" two years ago.In addition, the Danish animated documentary ""Flee"" registered an impressive showing, notching nominations in the animated, documentary and international film categories.The Academy's ongoing efforts to be more representative in terms of diversity and inconclusion continue to yield mixed results, with some notable oversights (see Ruth Negga for Netflix's ""Passing"") but major acting nominations for Denzel Washington (""The Tragedy of Macbeth""), Ariana DeBose (""West Side Story""), and Will Smith and Aunjanue Ellis (""King Richard"").Inevitably, the omissions will receive as much attention as the nominees, but by now it should be clear that the Oscars can never please everybody, especially with 10 best-picture nominees and only five slots for directors.Whether that somewhat disjointed roster adds up to a menu that will lure back more viewers remains to be seen. But if the Academy does see ratings rebound, the hero will be streaming, not Spider-Man."

The 28-year-old finished a shot ahead of Anirban Lahiri at TPC Sawgrass, going home with the winner's check of $3.6 million.Smith carded a six-under 66 to finish 13-under for the tournament and claim his second title of the season and fifth of his career. When asked what he was going to do with such a large amount of money in the press conference afterwards, Smith hadn't yet made up his mind. ""I really don't -- I don't have an answer for that. It hasn't sunk in,"" he said with a smile. Read More""That's a lot of money. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it.""Smith lines up his putt on the fourth hole during the final round of the Players Championship.The win held even more significance for Smith given who was within the crowd. Amongst the fans watching Smith claim victory in Florida were his mother and sister, who he said he hadn't seen in two-and-a-half years.Smith, who lives in Florida, explained that ""golf was second for these few weeks.""""It's really cool to have them here. My main priority really was just to hang out with them and golf was second for these few weeks.""It's nice to see them and nice to get a win for them.""The tournament -- one of the PGA Tour's marquee events -- was severely delayed due to inclement weather, with rain, darkness and lightning meaning it had to be finished on Monday rather the traditional Sunday final day. When play resumed early on Monday morning, all 71 players left in the field had to complete their third rounds.And after a quick turnaround, Smith began his final round strongly with a huge 38-foot birdie putt on the first hole. He registered five birdies in his opening six holes, before three consecutive bogeys from the seventh hole weakened his grip on the lead. But, under huge pressure, Smith reestablished his lead with four straight birdies to start the back nine, giving him a three-shot lead heading into the final hole. Lahiri birdied the 17th behind Smith to cut the lead to two, while on the 18th, Smith hit his ball into the water as it looked like the title might be slipping away. However, he managed to salvage bogey, leaving Lahiri needing a birdie to force a playoff, but the Indian golfer could only manage a par, cementing Smith's victory. The victory meant he became the fifth Australian to win the famous event, moving Smith up to sixth in golf's world rankings. Smith hits out of the pine straw along the 18th fairway during the final round of the Players Championship.""I felt as though one of these big ones was the next step for me,"" Smith said. ""I've knocked on the door a few times and I just felt like it was my time.When asked about joining his countrymen in winning the tournament, Smith said: ""Obviously, lots of Australians have won here, lots of great Australian golfers have won here, but the best that have ever lived have won here, as well.""So it's pretty cool to have the name on the same trophy as them."""

Towns scored 60 points in the Minnesota Timberwolves' 149-139 win over the San Antonio Spurs on Monday. Adding 17 rebounds to his night, the 26-year-old joined esteemed company -- alongside Karl Malone, Shaquille O'Neal, Michael Jordan, James Harden and Wilt Chamberlain -- in becoming the only players in NBA history to finish a game with 60 points and 15 rebounds.He finished with 19-for-31 overall shooting and was 7-for-11 on three-pointers. His 60 points is also a Minnesota franchise record, as well as a career-high for Towns, surpassing his previous record of 56. Towns shoots the ball during the game against the Spurs.The Timberwolves are embroiled in a hot playoff race in the Western Conference, and Towns said he understood the importance of the game beforehand, something he expressed to head coach Chris Finch. Read More""I told Coach (Finch) before the game: 'Hey listen, we need this win. I'll do whatever it takes,'"" Towns said. ""'If I need to play 44, 48 minutes, I'll get it done.' That was kind of the mindset I came in (with). I had to dominate. I had to be my best.""The win leaves Minnesota 1.5 games behind the Denver Nuggets for sixth place in the Western Conference playoff standings. Towns' scoring outburst came on an evening of big scores around the league. Two-time MVP Steph Curry scored 47 points in the Golden State Warriors' 126-112 win over the Washington Wizards, while Trae Young finished with 46 points in the Atlanta Hawks' 122-113 win over the Portland Trail Blazers.

Monday's scoring glut was the first time in league history that there were three players to score 45 points or more points in three different games during the regular season."

He couldn't have known it at the time, but he was in for a long stay at Iran's notorious Evin Prison: 544 days.The Washington Post reporter was eventually released in January 2016, and in Griner's case he sees many parallels to his own. ""It's the most audacious hostage taking by a state imaginable,"" Rezaian told CNN.""I know from my own case that the supposed charges against me were not based in anything like reality, and they were used to perpetuate a narrative about why I was being held.""Like Franks, Rezaian cautions against repeating the allegations against Griner verbatim.""I think that every time reporters repeat that narrative, we're doing some of the dirty work of the hostage takers for them.

News of her predicament didn't arrive in the US until March 5, when Russia revealed that they were holding her.Only then did Griner's wife, Cherelle, begin writing about it on Instagram. ""There are no words to express this pain,"" she said. ""I'm hurting, we're hurting.""If she can indeed be classified as a 'hostage,' Griner will join an unenviable club of around more than 50 American citizens who are currently held hostage or wrongfully detained overseas.Campaigners have been working to free Americans Reed and Paul Whelan, who are both in Russia.Whilst acknowledging that Griner's family have been placed under an enormous amount of emotional stress, Rezaian believes they should have spoken up sooner.

But despite that inevitability, it still made for gruesome yet compelling viewing, like peaking through your fingers while watching a horror movie.The sequel to that horror show was Saturday's 3-0 win against Bordeaux, in which a significant section of PSG fans turned on their own players. During the match, most of the squad was treated to a frosty reception by the Parc des Princes crowd -- and some received a frostier welcome than others.Read MoreMost notably Neymar and Lionel Messi, both of who were roundly booed by PSG fans during the build up to the opening goal. There was a loud cheer when Neymar turned the ball into the net, but those cheers promptly turned to jeers once the initial jubilation had subsided.READ: Karim Benzema scores hat-trick in 17 minutes as Real Madrid dumps PSG out of Champions LeagueLionel Messi and Neymar were on the receiving end of jeers from their own fans.Messi arrived in Paris to much fanfare in what was arguably the most shocking player move in history, but the signing has so far been painfully underwhelming for PSG fans.The Argentine has mustered a paltry two goals in 18 appearances in Ligue 1 this season, with five more coming in the Champions League, and has looked like a shadow of the player he was even in those later years at Barcelona.UEFA investigationThe humiliation against Real Madrid on the pitch was compounded by the widely reported behavior of PSG delegates off it.After the game, club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi and sporting director Leonardo reportedly confronted the officials in the referees' dressing room to express their anger at Real Madrid's first goal, which they believe came after Benzema had committed a foul on Donnarumma.UEFA later confirmed that a disciplinary case into the incident had been opened. ""The UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body will take a decision in due course,"" European football's governing body said.PSG declined to comment on the UEFA disciplinary case when contacted by CNN.While the frustration brought on by PSG's Champions League failures were directed at the players on the pitch on Saturday, Al-Khelaifi and Leonardo haven't escaped the ire of the club's supporters.In a statement released earlier on Saturday, club supporter group Collectif Ultra Paris called for Al-Khelaifi's resignation.Lionel Messi has managed just two goals in Ligue 1 all season.""How can a coach be the respected leader of the changing room when he is clearly not the true decision maker?"" was one of several questions posed in the statement.""We don't have a short memory. We know what our return owes to president Nasser Al-Khelaifi but it is clear he is not the man for the job.""The club's current situation requires complete reorganization at all levels going forward and the daily presence of its president.""On Monday, fan frustration was visible for all to see at PSG's training center and Parc des Princes stadium, where insults and calls for Al-Khelaifi and Leonardo to leave the club were sprayed onto the facilities.""Nasser, Leo out,"" read one piece of graffiti, thought to be aimed at Leonardo rather than Messi.Likewise, head coach Mauricio Pochettino did not escape from the Real Madrid debacle without any blame. Unsurprisingly, the Argentine has faced calls for his sacking or resignation, but Leonardo insisted that wasn't a solution.""We shouldn't throw everything in the bin,"" he told RMC Sport. ""We shouldn't start from scratch after every loss. The objective is to win the Champions League, and until half time we were fine.""We have to look to improve this team and maintain morale to play in Ligue 1 and to finish the season well. We should stay together. Pochettino is still part of the project for this season. It's not the time to think about that.""Mauricio Pochettino has come in for criticism following the Real Madrid defeat.With 10 games left in Ligue 1 and holding a 15-point lead over second-place Marseille, PSG is almost certain to secure it's seventh French league title in eight season.Following the win over Bordeaux, Pochettino said he was ""sad"" to hear the booing from the crowd and insisted their anger was also felt within the squad.""We were all affected,"" he said. ""We understand the disappointment and the frustration. We're all living it together, as a team. We have a duty to take responsibility for what happened. We share this disappointment with the supporters.""Player departures?One player who did manage to escape the booing was Kylian Mbappe.The striker, who was cheered throughout the match against Bordeaux, is the golden boy of French football and scored both of PSG's goals in the recent tie against Real Madrid. Despite the French club boasting both Messi and Neymar in its ranks, Mbappe is perhaps PSG's most prized asset.It will come as a significant concern, then, that there is the strong possibility of PSG losing Mbappe for free in the summer. The 23-year-old's current contract expires on June 30, 2022 and so far no headway has been made on a new deal.Mbappe told CNN at the end of December, just ahead of European football's January transfer window, that he would ""100%"" finish the season with PSG. However, he hasn't hidden his desire to move to pastures new -- specifically pastures in Madrid.When Real submitted a $188 million bid for Mbappe in August -- a deal that was close to being agreed -- the Frenchman admitted at the time that he wanted to leave PSG.""I was honest,"" Mbappe said. ""I gave a feeling, I gave what I have in my heart. I'm happy to stay ... it's my city too. I'm French ...

Known for being one of the most entertaining names in golf, the Irishman caused the Players Championship to erupt on Sunday, hitting a hole-in-one on the famous 17th. During the third round of one of the PGA Tour's marquee events, Lowry achieved the feat at the par-three, 124-yard island hole, which he described afterwards as ""one of the most iconic holes in golf.""The 34-year-old hit a pitching wedge with the ball landing approximately 10 feet past the hole before it gradually rolled towards the pin and dropped in, sparking wild scenes of celebration. He embraced his playing partner and Ryder Cup teammate Ian Poulter as the crowd went wild. Read MoreAfter picking the ball out of the hole, Lowry threw the ball into the crowd and later signed it.  ""It was a special thing to happen, and I'm looking forward to turning on my phone and seeing the messages I've got,"" Lowry explained. ""Not only that, it put me back in the tournament somewhat. So it was amazing. It's been a long day today, and I'm glad to make the call and finish well today. Played the 17 hole twice and did it in three shots, so it doesn't owe me anything.""I'm excited for tomorrow now. If it's a long day tomorrow, I can do something hopefully in the morning and finish it off in the afternoon.""It's the 10th hole-in-one on the 17th hole at TPC Sawgrass, and the first since Ryan Moore achieved the feat at the 2019 edition of the Players Championship. It is Lowry's second hole-in-one on the PGA Tour, his first coming at the 2016 Masters. Lowry plays his shot from the 10th tee during the third round of the Players Championship.Lowry is now four-under for the tournament, four off the top of the leaderboard. This year's Players Championship has had severe delays after inclement weather swept into the area in Florida. Because of high winds, raining and electric storms, when play resumes on Monday morning, all 71 players left in the field will still have to complete their third rounds. India's Anirban Lahiri leads on nine under."

It's a focus that has shone a light on the jarring friction between sport and politics: Abramovich the dream-realizing football owner -- adored by much of the Chelsea fanbase -- versus Abramovich the Russian oligarch.Days after the war began, as the West responded by imposing sanctions on Russia and its oligarchs, Abramovich's assets -- including Chelsea -- appeared increasingly vulnerable to a more punitive financial environment and he soon announced his plans to sell the club.Before the sale could be completed, however, the UK government announced that Abramovich would be subject to sanctions as one of ""Russia's wealthiest and most influential oligarchs, whose business empires, wealth and connections are closely associated with the Kremlin.""Read MoreChelsea FC: British property developer Nick Candy ""still interested in"" buying club despite Roman Abramovich sanctionsOn Saturday, the English Premier League's board disqualified Roman Abramovich as a director of Chelsea.The disqualification of an owner would normally trigger the sale of their shareholding, though in the case of Abramovich the Russian oligrach had already announced his intention to sell the club and that process is underway.The UK government is open to Chelsea's sale and would consider an application for a new licence to allow for a sale to take place, a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday.Chelsea will be somewhat shielded from the sanctions, allowed to continue fulfilling its fixtures under a special license. But it does mean the club is not able to sell merchandise or tickets to upcoming games, engage in the transfer market, or issue new contracts to players.Last month British lawmaker Chris Bryant called for Abramovich to lose ownership of Chelsea after seeing a leaked 2019 UK Home Office document that flagged concerns the 55-year-old had ""links to the Russian state and his public association with corrupt activity and practices,"" the MP said in Parliament.According to Reuters, Abramovich has been granted Portuguese and Israeli citizenship in recent years.  ""Surely, Mr. Abramovich should no longer be able to own a football club in this country?"" Bryant said.Abramovich's representative did not respond to CNN's request for comment on the oligarch being sanctioned.Spurred by Abramovich's enormous financial investment -- upwards of $1.99 billion according to respected football business blogger Swiss Ramble -- Chelsea has enjoyed an unprecedented period of success since his $233 million acquisition of the club in June 2003.""I don't want to throw my money away,"" Abramovich told the BBC following the takeover, ""but it's really about having fun and that means success and trophies.""During the 19 years under Abramovich, the club has collected 21 major trophies, according to Chelsea. After winning the FIFA Club World Cup in Abu Dhabi last month, Chelsea has officially won ever major trophy at the club's disposal.JUST WATCHEDHow Chelsea fans are reacting to sanctions on club ownerReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow Chelsea fans are reacting to sanctions on club owner 02:56'Thank you Mr Abramovich'It is gratitude for this golden era that underpinned a sweeping tide of adulation for the oligarch upon the announcement of his impending sale of the club, among fans as well as former players.""The best,"" former captain John Terry tweeted, accompanied by a picture of him and Abramovich celebrating another Premier League triumph in 2017.A statement from the Chelsea Supporters Trust (CST) board encapsulated the broader outpouring of feeling among the club's fans on social media, thanking Abramovich for ""his affection, passion and dedication"" during a tenure that brought ""unparalleled success.""""Chelsea supporters will never forget all he has done for our club. Thank you Mr Abramovich,"" the statement added, published before the UK government announced the sanctions.According to Richard Weekes, who is one of the founders of Chelsea supporters' group 'We Are The Shed,' ""the Roman Empire"" helped realize supporters' wildest dreams.""The last 20 years has enabled Chelsea supporters to live their best lives,"" Weekes told CNN before Abramovich would be sanctioned.""Traveling around the world winning and celebrating the biggest prizes in football, you simply cannot ask for more than that and, for that reason, Roman will forever have a place in all Chelsea supporters' hearts.""To have 'the Roman Empire' come to an end with Chelsea as 'Champions of the World' could not be a more fitting conclusion to this chapter in our history.""'Scorched air'If the last 19 years have been jam-packed with golden memories and trophy after trophy, the coming days and months look more uncertain.In light of the sanctions placed on Abramovich and the consequential impact on Chelsea, the club released a statement confirming it would seek ""permission for the licence to be amended in order to allow the Club to operate as normal as possible.""Amid such turmoil, the CST called for the voices of supporters to be heard.""Supporters MUST be involved in any conversation regarding ongoing impacts on the club and its global fanbase,"" the group said in a statement on Twitter. ""The CST implores the Government to conduct a swift process to minimise the uncertainty over Chelsea's future, for supporters and for supporters to be given a golden share as part of a sale of the club.""Chelsea beat Norwich 3-1 in its latest English Premier League match on March 10. The sanctions also prevent a sale of the club, pending the issuance of a special license.In his initial statement published on the club's website before he was sanctioned, Abramovich said the net proceeds from the sale will be donated to a foundation set up ""for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine.""  That statement was conspicuously vague regarding who specifically might be a victim; Abramovich's critics pointed out that the wording could also allow his new foundation to support the families of Russian soldiers.  ""Roman Abramovich is very sensitive to what is happening now,"" Mikhail Khordokovsky, an exiled oligarch and Putin critic, told CNN before the recent sanctions were announced. ""I don't have any information, but I can't imagine that he's made any decision without first consulting with Putin.""Regardless, this means that he's gotten a whiff of scorched air. What he smells is the fire burning under President Putin,"" Khodorkovsky said, referring to Abramovich's plans to sell Chelsea.What CAN the club do?Pay allowances and pensions of all employees of the Club, including the wages of Players and coaching staff.Pay reasonable costs of travel to and from Fixtures but ""not exceeding the value of £20,000 per game per Club team.""Pay reasonable costs necessary for the purposes of the Club hosting Fixtures at its home grounds but ""not exceeding the value of £500,000 per Fixture per Club Team.""Pay fees, dividends or other allowances to directors of the Club.Pay ""reasonable fees"" or other costs directly related to ongoing regular maintenance of the Club.Broadcasters may broadcast any Fixtures involving the Club.In 2018 the US Treasury released the names of 210 prominent Russians, dubbed the ""Putin list.""The administration was required to name the companies and individuals and consider whether to sanction them under legislation meant to punish Russia for its interference in the 2016 US election, as well as its human rights violations, annexation of Crimea, and ongoing military operations in eastern Ukraine.The list, which included  Abramovich, reads like the US has ""simply rewritten the Kremlin's phone book,"" said Russian senator Konstantin Kosachev in a Facebook post at the time.But if Abramovich's current wealth and apparent safety in Russia reflect an affinity with Putin, that may have been what put him at risk with the UK government. Vladimir Putin: The world of sport has shunned the Russian president. So what?""He is one of the few oligarchs from the 1990s to maintain prominence under Putin. None of our allies have yet sanctioned Abramovich,"" the UK government said in a statement on Thursday. Canada have since sanctioned Abramovich too.Abramovich made his fortune in steel and investments, taking advantage of the mass privatization that characterized Boris Yeltsin's premiership following the fall of the Soviet Union.Abramovich's wealth, valued at $14.5 billion in 2022 by Forbes, led to influence within Russian political circles as he was first elected to the State Duma and then appointed governor of Chukotka from 2000 to 2008.A nervous futureWhile Weekes admitted that the incoming owner's status as an oligarch had played on his mind back in 2003, he added that fans would have had little power to reverse the takeover regardless of their feelings.""Chelsea fans did not choose to be bought,"" Weekes said, ""it is unlikely any pushback would have changed the decision at the time had we stopped to think about the morality behind it.""Today people are more prepared to look into things a little deeper, to understand right from wrong and, with regards to a football club, have the desire to know that who is representing their team suits their ideologies and beliefs. This is a good thing.""Only time will tell if our feeling towards his character will change but, for now, there is no denying the happiness he brought to Chelsea supporters during his time here and for that we are thankful.""What CAN'T the club do?Enter into transfer deals for new players or receive money for selling existing players.Issue new contracts to existing players.Sell any new tickets to upcoming games -- only season ticket holders can go to games for the foreseeable future.Sell any merchandise -- however, any third parties who purchased or produced Club Merchandise prior to Thursday are permitted to sell stock.This schism between appreciation and criticism manifested itself in Chelsea's league fixtures at Burnley on March 5 and at Norwich City on March 10.As a minute's applause was held in tribute to Ukraine before the Burnley game, chants of Abramovich's name could be heard on a Sky Sports broadcast before being drowned out by boos from the stands.The chants drew reproach from Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel after the game.""If we show solidarity, we show solidarity and we should do it together. We take the knee together, if an important person from other clubs or from our club unfortunately dies, we show a minute of respect,"" Tuchel told reporters after the game, which Chelsea won 4-0. ""It's not the moment to give other messages, it's a moment to show respect. We do this because this is what we are also as a club, we show respect as a club. We need our fans to commit to this minute of applause in the moment. ""We do it for Ukraine, there is no second opinion about the situation there. They have our thoughts and our support, and we should stand together as a club.""Players, officials and fans took part in a minute of applause to indicate peace and sympathy with Ukraine before Burnley faced Chelsea.Beyond this mixture of sentiment among fans is an equally strong feeling of anxiety. Rumors of potential buyers continue to abound, but as yet it remains to be seen when the club's future will be clarified.Who will the new owner be? Will they be capable or willing to invest the same funds as Abramovich? Would they try to move Chelsea away from Stamford Bridge? After almost two decades of looking ahead to nothing but success, these questions and more have Weekes' mind ""whirling.""""In the end Roman explicitly outlined that owning Chelsea was never for financial gain, will the new owner fell that way? Unlikely,"" Weekes said.""That is worrying, as, on top of everything, it might be the supporters that end up paying the price."""

So what? - CNN",Vladimir Putin: The world of sport has shunned the Russian president. So what?,"(CNN)As Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine, the grim reality of war has taken center stage, with more than two million Ukrainians fleeing the country and hundreds dead, according to the UN.Russia is already paying a price for its aggression -- countries around the world are imposing sanctions and the Russian ruble has plunged even further against the dollar, hitting record lows.A plethora of international sports organizations and governing bodies have also responded to the invasion targeting Russia and its athletes with sanctions of varying severity, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has been stripped of multiple honorary sporting titles.Notably Russian and Belarusian athletes were not allowed to compete at the 2022 Winter Paralympics in Beijing after multiple other countries' athletes and teams threatened not to compete at the Games, according to the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has recommended a ban for Russian and Belarusian athletes competing in international competition.""The situation is monstrous, of course. This is a disgrace for the International Paralympic Committee,"" said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters following the decision.Russian tanks emblazoned with 'Z' were first spotted on Ukraine's border. Here's how the letter became a pro-war symbolRead MoreThe IOC also announced that it had withdrawn the Olympic Order -- the highest award of the Olympic movement -- from Putin.""The IOC was viewed as having a close relationship with Russia,"" Michael Payne, former head of marketing at the IOC, told CNN. ""The fact that the IOC has now issued a set of sanctions to Russia, which, in my view, are probably the strongest sanctions the IOC has ever issued ... since probably the early 60s when the IOC banned South Africa for its apartheid regime,"" he said.Meanwhile, world football's governing body, FIFA, and European soccer body, UEFA, have suspended all Russian international and club teams from their competitions ""until further notice.""Vladimir Putin kicks a football during an event in the Red Square on June 28, 2018 in Moscow.""Vladimir Putin has been passionate about both sports and using sport to project Russia's importance on the world stage and giving back to the Russian people a sense of pride in their success on the world stage.""Payne added that the most immediate impact of sanctions could be to challenge the Kremlin's narrative on the conflict, with ordinary Russians wondering what has happened to events they were due to host.UEFA announced last month that this year's Champions League final will no longer take place in St. Petersburg's Krestovsky Stadium, which is sponsored by Russian state-owned company Gazprom, and will now be moved to the Stade de France in Paris to be played on the original date of May 28.""There can be no misunderstanding: no amount of control of the Russian media is able to explain what's going on in the sports world, that they've suddenly been banished,"" Payne said.Russia is covering the country's invasion of Ukraine very differently to CNN and other western news outlets. A new law forbids media operating in Russia to use the words ""war,"" ""attack"" or ""invasion"" to describe Putin's decision to unleash his forces against Ukraine. Instead, they are to use the Kremlin's Orwellian phrase: ""special military operation.""Russians' access to social media like Facebook and Twitter has also been severely restricted.""Sanctions may cause ordinary Russians to ask why can't they see their Russian athletes performing? And clearly, then there's prompting the Russian people to say 'What's going on?'"" Payne said.​""Will Putin care about having to give his Olympic gold order back or what the rest of the international world thinks of him? Probably not. ""Will he care about what all the local Russians are saying, 'Hang on, what is going on?' Absolutely."" Sports as a nationalist toolLukas Aubin, associate researcher at The French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs (IRIS) and a specialist in the geopolitics of Russia and sports, told CNN Sport that Putin carefully curates his image so that observers are aware of his sporting prowess, on a national and international level.""When Putin arrived at power in 2000, one of his first decisions was to invite his former coach in judo [to the Kremlin],"" he said.The Russian premier has also been pictured ice swimming, fishing and bare-chested horseback riding.Putin attends a gala match of the Night Hockey League teams at the Bolshoy ice arena on May 10, 2017 in Sochi, Russia. ""Today, President Putin uses sports as an element of his power. And not only as a part of his personality because he also has created a big sporting system. He's using oligarchs, politics, former athletes, to create a machine.""It's a big system, where people [are] driven by Putin in the directions that they need to create a beautiful picture of Russia, in the world of sports,"" he added.This worked for the most part, Aubin said.""It worked because in 2014, we are seeing the Sochi Olympics. Then four years after, we are seeing the World Cup. It is really very hard to say how many international sporting events Russia [has] hosted the past 10 years -- it's really a lot. At the beginning, it was a huge element of soft power,"" Aubin added.  Vera Tolz, professor of Russian studies at the University of Manchester, told CNN Sport that Putin has used Russian nationalism ""instrumentally and very systematically"" as a way of legitimizing his regime since he came to power.Winter Paralympics: Ukrainian athletes' thoughts are with those fighting the invasion back home as they enjoy golden success in Beijing""Nationalism -- and the kind of national unification with promoting particular versions of history, of organizing, establishing new national holidays, and of course, sport -- has been absolutely key to his legitimation strategy,"" she explained, adding such tactics date back to the Soviet period, where sport was used ""very intensively as a tool of building loyalty of the people to the regime.""""Even the fact that the Kremlin, Russia, has gone to such lengths, in using doping, in order to win more medals, in a way shows how participating in competitions and winning, winning was key to Putin's Popular Mobilization strategy,"" Tolz added. In 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) unanimously agreed to ban Russia from major international sporting competitions -- notably the Olympics and the World Cup -- for four years over doping non-compliance. The ban was later halved by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2020.WADA's punishment relates to inconsistencies in data retrieved by WADA in January 2019 from the Moscow lab at the center of the 2016 McLaren report, which uncovered a widespread and sophisticated state-sponsored sports doping network.""Every time you let Russia into an international sporting event, you're essentially agreeing to swim with man-eating sharks. They will cheat your athletes, they will not feel bad about it, they will lie about it, if they're caught, they will blame you for calling it out,"" Jim Walden, the US lawyer of Grigory Rodchenkov who was instrumental in exposing Russia's initial cover-up, told CNN.Ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, Putin spoke of his frustration of the ""politicization of sport"" and that the ""the rights and interests of our athletes must be protected from any arbitrariness.""The Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) was initially deemed non-compliant after the publication of the McLaren report in 2016.Putin looks on during the Opening Ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics on February 4. Commissioned by WADA, the report found the Russian state conspired with athletes and sporting officials to undertake a doping program that was unprecedented in its scale and ambition.""Putin very much uses his control over sport to try to game the world and win as much as possible, and also curates the content for the Russian population so that he can get maximum popularity, which translates into maximum power to do what he wants internationally -- essentially pitting Russia against the rest of the world, at least the rest of the Western world,"" Walden added.Fast forward to 2022 and another doping scandal -- surrounding Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva -- overshadowed the Winter Olympics in Beijing.The 15-year-old Valieva, a breakout star of the Games who got the highest mark in the figure skating team event, was allowed to compete despite testing positive for the banned heart drug trimetazidine, which is commonly used to treat people with angina. The failed test occurred before the Winter Olympics but only came to light during the Games, and it remains unclear if the drug test controversy will see the medal revoked.""Not only is Russia myopically focused on winning at any cost, but in terms of any costs, it's no holds barred, right? So murder, bribery, drug trafficking, any kind of criminality that will give them an advantage. They believe that not only will they do it, but that other people are weak for following the rules,"" Walden said.""So they marry criminality with obstruction and put that together with sports. And that is how they have consistently won. And that's how the Russian government has used it to prop up its own popularity, so that it has more leeway to engage in troublemaking abroad,"" he added.Trail of moneyOlympic great Edwin Moses, who opposed the 1980 US boycott of the Moscow Olympics, has gone so far as to call for Russia to be banned from the 2024 Olympics.""The boycott in 1980 was political. This is just horrible,"" Moses, who is Chairman of the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, said in a press release from Laureus last week.""It hasn't got a lot to do with politics, it has to do with humanity, the war, the fighting, the children and innocent people getting killed, rockets and missiles, tanks ... and it's live on TV, so everyone is aware of it.""I was in favor of banning the Russians because of what happened in Sochi in 2014 for really corrupting the integrity of the Olympic Games, via doping. I was on the executive committee of the World Anti-Doping Agency, and I thought the penalties were too light.""What they're doing to the entire world right now in Ukraine, is exactly the same thing they've done to sport, in my opinion. Russia ought to be banned in Paris [2024 Olympic Games].""A few years ago, Moses says he met Putin.""I once sat next to him at [a] table. Two seats to my left, and the translator was in between. And I spoke to him that entire evening. I know how he talked about sports, like it was the Holy Grail, and how important sport was, and how it was good where the best of everyone's country, regardless of your philosophy can compete together, and whoever wins, wins....

They grew up dreaming of fighting their way to fame and glory, and together they conquered the world with their fists.Between them, the 35-year-old Usyk and the 34-year-old Lomachenko won three Olympic gold medals and have since established themselves among the elite boxers in the world. But now they are facing a very different fight -- an existential one -- for the very future of their country. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, Usyk and Lomachenko have traveled into Ukraine, taken up arms and joined the territorial defense battalion.Speaking via a video link from a basement in Kyiv, Usyk exclusively told CNN that it's not just invading forces he needs to look out for, but looters as well. He says that he's prepared to take a life, if necessary.""If they will want to take my life, or the lives of my close ones, I will have to do it,"" he said. ""But I don't want that. I don't want to shoot, I don't want to kill anybody, but if they will be killing me, I will have no choice.""Read MoreUsyk's manager, Egis Klimas, helped coordinate the interview and translated for Usyk, who doesn't speak English. Despite the terrifying situation that many Ukrainians now find themselves in, Usyk says that he isn't afraid.""Maybe, it'll sound sentimental,"" he explained, ""but my soul belongs to the Lord and my body and my honor belong to my country, to my family. So there is no fear, absolutely no fear. There's just bafflement -- how could this be in the 21st century?""He's not in Ukraine to box right now, but the noble art is still useful in this moment. ""It has helped me to be calm and mentally prepared,"" he said, ""And it helps me to help others who are panicking and nervous."" Oleksandr Usyk tells CNN that his ""country and my honor are more important to me than a championship belt.""Both men were outside of the country when Russia invaded; Usyk had been in London, shooting sequences for an upcoming video game.He was intending to fly home just hours after the hostilities had commenced, but with the airports closed, he instead flew to Warsaw in Poland and drove almost 500 miles back home and over the border to Kyiv.Lomachenko had been visiting a monastery in Greece and returned home the next day. Instead of flying directly to his hometown of Odessa, he traveled to Bucharest in Romania, then drove for nine hours to the port and caught a ferry into Ukraine.Their manager told CNN that he didn't know they were thinking of taking up arms until they had already signed up for the defense battalion. Former world boxing champions, Vitali -- who is also the Mayor of Kyiv -- and Wladimir Klitschko, have also taken up arms in defense of their nation.Elina Svitolina: Worried for her parents, Ukrainian tennis star says she has been suffering sleepless nights'The bombing around is crazy'Lomachenko was scheduled to speak with CNN at the same time as Usyk but wasn't responding to the calls from his manager at the time. Early Wednesday morning local time, Klimas confirmed to CNN that Lomachenko was safe and sound.He and Usyk remain close: they are godfathers to each other's children and celebrate family birthdays together. Six days into the war, Usyk knows that nowhere is safe anymore in Ukraine.""The bombing around is crazy,"" Usyk said. ""They just bombed the city of Mariupol, one of my friends got a rocket in his roof. [The Russians] are not playing games."" As the fighting rages, so too does the debate about whether Russian athletes should be sanctioned for the actions of their country. Usyk chose not to weigh in directly, suggesting that there are innocent people on both sides of the conflict.""Russian people don't really know exactly what's going on here. They're not seeing what's going on. They are victims of their President [Vladimir Putin].""Usyk won his heavyweight title belts in a superb display in September 2021 against former champion Anthony Joshua.Usyk has only just become the IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO world heavyweight champion. In September, he defeated Anthony Joshua in London in a superb boxing display to claim the belts. His manager says that talks of a rematch this summer are at an advanced stage.The lightweight Lomachenko has previously been world champion in three different weight classes and was planning to fight George Kambosos in Australia in June.But understandably, boxing is the last thing on their minds.""I really don't know when I'm going to be stepping back in the ring,"" said Usyk, who looked exhausted and emotional in his interview with CNN. ""My country and my honor are more important to me than a championship belt.""Usyk has three children and, during the interview, the sound of young voices could be heard playing behind him in the basement. He says that family, friends and neighbors have been sheltering together. ""When there is an air raid alarm, we hide. Of course, it's fun when there are a lot of us here -- we're having fun. But we're forcing ourselves to have fun.""

","sport, Obituary: Shane Warne was cricket's great showman and entertainer - CNN",Obituary: Shane Warne was cricket's great showman and entertainer,"(CNN)Whether it was his bleach blonde hair or his devastating spin bowling which had batters quivering and quaking, Shane Warne did things his own way. The Australian cricket great died at the age of 52 from a suspected heart attack on Friday, according to a statement from his management team. Warne took over 1,000 international wickets, including 708 Test wickets -- second only to Sri Lanka's Muttiah Muralitharan -- during his illustrious career and retired from cricket in 2013 as one of the greatest to ever play the sport. He was a leading figure of the dominant Australian side of the late 1990s and early 2000s, winning multiple Ashes series and the World Cup in 1999. Allied to his dominance with the ball was his charismatic personality, which transformed Warne from cricket star to global sporting superstar. Read More""Warnie was an all time great, a once in a century type cricketer, and his records will live on forever,"" said current Australia captain Pat Cummins, dubbing Warne ""King"" in his statement.  ""We all grew up watching Warnie, idolising him, we all had posters on his wall, had his earrings. What we loved so much about Warnie was his showmanship, his charisma, his tactics, the way he willed himself and the team around him to will teams around him to win games for Australia, and above all else his incredible skills as a leg-spinner.""There's so many guys in this team and squad who still hold him as a hero ... all-time favorite player. The game was never the same after Warnie emerged and the game will never be the same after his passing.""Rest in peace, King.""Warne celebrates with his teammates after taking the wicket Sachin Tendulkar in 1999.Ball of the centuryWarne wasn't just a bowler capable of dominating matches almost single handedly, he was also an entertainer, happy to engage in banter with England fans and often the subject of tabloid headlines.If his first year as an international player gave a few indications that he was destined for success, a single ball he bowled in Manchester in 1993 completely changed perceptions about the bowler.Just a year after making his international debut in 1992, Warne was playing in his first Ashes series in England. Adorned with his short, bright blonde hair and wielding his now famous right-arm bowling action, Warne produced a bamboozling delivery in what has been dubbed the ""ball of the century.""The delivery looked to be heading past England batter Mike Gatting's leg stump. Then it bounced on the pitch, spun dramatically and missed Gatting's bat before astonishingly hitting the off-stump. Like many others, Gatting looked astounded that such an initially harmless-looking delivery had cost him his wicket --  former England player Graham Gooch said: ""He looked as though someone had just nicked his lunch.""Warne bowling during the Third Ashes test match against England at Old Trafford cricket ground on July 4, 1997.Warne's ability to flight and spin the ball to such devastating effect helped revive leg-spin from a forgotten art into a key component in modern day cricket. ""The highlight of my cricketing career was to keep wicket to Warnie,"" Adam Gilchrist, Australia's legendary wicketkeeper and Warne's longtime teammate, wrote on Twitter.""Best seat in the house to watch the maestro at work. Have often felt a tad selfish, that Heals and I pretty much exclusively are the only ones who had that thrill and pleasure at Test level. Rip Warnie.Other cricket greats were quick to pay tribute to Warne's remarkable talent.""Shocked, stunned & miserable,"" wrote Indian Sachin Tendulkar -- widely considered one of the best batters of all time.""There was never a dull moment with you around, on or off the field. Will always treasure our on field duels & off field banter. You always had a special place for India & Indians had a special place for you. ""Gone too young!""Former India international batter Virender Sehwag said on Twitter: ""One of the greatest spinners, the man who made spin cool, superstar Shane Warne is no more.""Life is very fragile, but this is very difficult to fathom. My heartfelt condolences to his family, friends and fans all around the world.""'I am shocked to the core'During his career which spanned over 20 years, Warne won numerous trophies and accolades.In Australia's victorious World Cup team in 1999, Warne collected the man of the match award in the final. He was named one of Wisden's five best players of the 20th century, as well as being selected in an all-time Test World XI by Wisden to commemorate 150 years of the cricketers' almanack. Away from international cricket, Warne also played a pivotal role in making the Indian Premier League (IPL) the behemoth it is today. In 2008, he led the Rajasthan Royals to the inaugural IPL title, something he believes gave the tournament ""credibility because the underdog came good."" ""To then go and win it in the style we did, that put the IPL on the map. Any underdog story like that -- you look at Leicester City, what they did. It's a pretty amazing story,"" Warne told CNN in 2019, referring to the soccer underdog's remarkable Premier League title triumph in 2016.""I was very lucky to play in an era of Australian cricket where we were super successful. We beat every team home and away, won World Cups, Ashes series, so we had some huge results.""To be part of all of that with the Aussies and do those things was great but the IPL, it was completely different.""Warne poses for photos after speaking to the media during a Melbourne Stars Twenty20 Big Bash League announcement on November 8, 2011.Warne played his entire domestic cricket career in Australia with his native Victoria, but had stints with Hampshire in England. ""Absolutely shocked and gutted to hear about Shane Warne, wrote former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara. ""Legend and friend. Just can't believe it.""Former West Indies batter Vivian Richards also said on Twitter: ""Unbelievable. I am shocked to the core. This can't be true... Rest In Peace, Shane Warne. There are no words to describe what I feel right now. A huge loss for cricket."""

But I'm not giving up.""Williams was forced to miss January's Australian Open following the advice of her medical team, announcing in December that she wasn't ""where I need to be physically to compete.""Speaking to Amanpour in Paris, Williams said she will play at the French Open in May -- the next grand slam in the tennis calendar -- if her body allows.Read More""Paris is one of my favorite cities, and I actually love the clay. So we'll see what happens. Hopefully if my body is holding up, then I'll definitely be there.""Williams in action at the 2021 French Open.Changing the narrativeWilliams' rise from a young girl learning to play tennis on dilapidated courts in Compton, California, to become one of the most successful and decorated athletes in history is the stuff of legend.Now immortalized in the Hollywood film ""King Richard"" -- which Williams and her sister Venus executive produced -- their father was pivotal in the duo's development as players.Played by Will Smith, the film shows how Richard Williams catapulted his daughters to tennis stardom.Serena Williams hugs her father, Richard, after winning Wimbledon in 2012.Often portrayed as a divisive and eccentric character, Williams told CNN how the sisters aimed to change the narrative around their dad.""Unfortunately, entering a new sport where it's predominantly, you know, White and having my dad have like this villain character, when it just wasn't true, just having to deal with that my entire career, from day one to the very end, was just really important for us just to tell the truth,"" she said.JUST WATCHEDSerena Williams is investing in diversity ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSerena Williams is investing in diversity  03:28""You know, in order to be an athlete, especially in a single sport, it takes a lot of work, and it takes a lot of dedication.

It's a lot of work.""Serena's older sister Venus paved the way, turning professional one year earlier than her, winning seven grand slam singles titles so far in her career. Venus still competes on the tour, aged 41.Initially, Serena lived in Venus' shadow.""My sister was much better than me. I was not very good growing up. And so, everyone was focused on Venus. And in the film, it goes into that, how when we had an opportunity to have better coaches, they saw that Venus was the one.""And so, that was devastating for me ... but helpful. Because if that hadn't happened, I wouldn't have had the career that I have because I felt like I just had to prove and just had to win.""Serena and Venus attend the premiere of Warner Bros' ""King Richard"" in Hollywood in November 2021.Williams turned to her mother, Oracene Price, who played a critical but often overlooked role in her success.""I just had to work with mom. I didn't get to work with the prestigious coaches or anything. And my mom made me tough mentally,"" she added.'We had to be better'Serena, Venus and their dad came up against racism throughout their careers, most notably in 2001 at Indian Wells.Asked by Amanpour how they perceived and overcame the racism that they experienced as tennis players in a predominantly White sport, Williams responded: ""We changed it from being two great Black champions to being the best ever, period. And that's what we did. We took out color, and we just became the best.""And yes, we had to play harder, and we had to be better, but it made us better.""And at the end of the day, every time we faced a challenge and every time we overcame that challenge, we created Venus and Serena.""Williams also discussed her venture fund Serena Ventures, which this week announced $111 million had been raised to invest in founders of diverse backgrounds.""It's really about diversity,"" Williams told Amanpour, explaining that she was spurred to action when she learnt that less than 2% of all venture capital money went to women.""Because of tennis, I have a way to impact VC in a different way and bringing diversity to that as well,"" she said.Venus (L) defeated sister Serena in an all-Williams 2008 Wimbledon final.Double standardsAt times, Williams has shown anger and exasperation with umpires on the court, most infamously at the 2018 US Open final which she lost to Naomi Osaka.She was heavily criticized and fined over the episode.Amanpour asked Williams if she feels double standards exist in the sport, given men routinely act out at umpires, often with impunity.Williams argues with umpire Carlos Ramos during her US Open final match against Osaka in 2018.Responding to a recent incident involving German player Alexander Zverev, in which he struck the umpire's chair multiple times with his racket and was subsequently withdrawn from the Mexican Open and fined, Williams said: ""There is absolutely a double standard. I would probably be in jail if I did that. Like literally, no joke.""And as she chases Court's grand slam record, Williams is also aware that her career and life won't only be defined by how many titles she might win.""I am who I am, I love who I am -- I love the impact that I've had on people, that I continue to have on people,"" said Williams, who Amanpour interviewed on February 28, four days after Russia invaded Ukraine.""Right now the world in such turmoil ... when you look at what's happening in Ukraine and Russia, it's just sad to see,"" added Williams.""Human life ... is so valuable, and it doesn't matter who you are, where you're from, it should be amazing and of value."""

As he himself documented on his Instagram, Varner was ranked 1,510th in the world in 2014.Since then, the American has seen a steady improvement year by year, rising through the ranks. But it took a moment of magic that he will never forget to finally crack the top 50 in the world.

Between December 2016 and February 2022, Varner didn't win a professional golf tournament. But his belief never wavered during that time. ""I've never questioned my ability,"" he said. ""The only people that question it are the people that sit right in here, and they're like, 'Man, he needs to be winning.' But I don't march to anyone's beat in here. I do what I'm supposed to do and things come.""Life happened. My wife, my girlfriend at the time, her brother died a week after that and we were celebrating.

But what if fate not only brings you together, but also places you in direct competition on one of the world's biggest sporting stages?That was the destiny of tennis sensation Cori ""Coco"" Gauff in 2019 when, as the youngest ever qualifier at Wimbledon, she found herself facing the legendary Venus Williams.""I just remember walking out on the court blasting music with my head held down because I didn't want to look at the crowd,"" Gauff told CNN's Becky Anderson in Dubai. ""It was such a long walk from the locker room. It was, like, 15 minutes,"" she recalls. ""Then they have all the walls of the champions, and obviously, I saw Venus there so many times. I was like, 'Oh my gosh, she's lifted this trophy so many times. And here I am like, about to go on against her.'""What happened next was the stuff of fantasy, as the teenager swept her veteran rival aside in straight sets. Stone-faced, almost disbelieving, Gauff walked slowly towards a beaming Williams, who congratulated her warmly from across the net as the crowd erupted in wild applause.Cori ""Coco"" Gauff greets Venus Williams at the net after winning their women's singles match at Wimbledon 2019.Read MoreElegant dominanceAlmost three years on, Gauff still finds inspiration from Venus and her sister Serena. ""I'm inspired by both of them,"" she says. ""And I would say, I don't know, I just think not only their games, but how they handled themselves off the court is something that I look up to.""Gauff also acknowledges the importance of having two Black role models in a sport that has traditionally lacked diversity. ""For me, there's not much representation of people that look like me in this sport; so, for me as a young girl, just seeing them dominate and do it so elegantly, kind of just inspired me.""Serena Williams Fast FactsVenus has also become something of a Coco Gauff fan, too. ""I've gotten to have conversations with them, like Venus, I got to play doubles with [her]. That was just something I never thought of happening. And she's always rooting for me. ""I remember her posting Instagram stories saying, people ask her questions like, 'Who she's rooting for?' and she would say, 'Serena,' and then she will say, also me, and I thought that's just really cool because I never thought that would happen. ""I mean, as a kid, I never thought I'd play either of them, let alone play doubles with one of them!""Gauff plays a backhand in her first round singles match of the Australian Open in January 2022.Role modelAlthough she will only turn 18 in March, Gauff is already treading her own path as a role model for others. She spoke out during the protests following the murder of George Floyd and believes in using her position to inspire change.  ""For me, I just feel like it's not so much of responsibility, I feel like that's just me, and that's like my identity,"" she told Anderson.""I want to stand up for people who look like me and feel like they don't have a voice. And I'm lucky enough that some people in the world care about what I have to say. So I try to make sure that I say it and say in a correct way, or in a way that people understand.""  She says she is mindful of setting an example to her two younger brothers. ""I would say I just kind of try to hold myself to what I want my brothers to be, [and be] a role model for my brothers.""'Your mindset can change everything in your life'The Atlanta-born star also draws her own inspiration from closer to home. Her grandmother survived cancer, and Gauff says watching that battle, and the positive mindset with which her grandmother approached it, was a learning experience. ""I think your mind kind of controls everything. Your mind controls, you know, how your body feels and how your mood is,"" she explains.  ""One of the things I learned growing up, my grandmother she had lung cancer when I was younger, and now she's cancer free, but I just remember her never being too negative about it, and her always being positive.""Gauff and Anderson on court for a friendly match.That attitude made a lasting impression on the youngster and her views on mental health. ""I remembered my grandmother telling me that the only reason she thinks she conquered it -- because she had stage four and the chances weren't looking good -- was that she would just wake up every day so mentally in a positive and happy light. ""You know, as a kid, I didn't really understand what was going on. But I remember just never seeing her sad or upset or saying, 'Why me?' Instead, she was saying, like, 'Why not me?' So I think for me, now at this age, that showed me that your mindset can change everything in your life. So, if you're not good mentally, you know, it could be as painful.""Limiting social mediaA new pressure that young sports stars are born into now is the spotlight of social media, and Gauff says that she has learned to avoid spending too much time online. ""I'm really rarely on Twitter or Instagram. I'm just there to like my friends' posts and comment and then log off again,"" she says. ""I would say TikTok is the only one that I'm on the most, just because I don't see much tennis, I don't see much about me on the app, which I like.""Resisting the temptation to try and please everyone on social media is important, Gauff believes. ""I feel like a lot of people have a lot of nice things to say, I would say definitely the positive outweighs the bad. But I guess, you know, I feel like as a human you kind of want to look at what people are saying to you and saying about you. ""As humans, we have it in our heads to please everyone, so you want to know what bad things people think about you so you can fix it. But some things are just, you just can't fix it. And so I just kind of stay off it.""Gauff said she tries not to spend too much time on social media.It is a single-minded philosophy that seems to extend to other areas of her life, too. Gauff is a firm believer in following your own path for your own reasons. ""If you're not doing it for yourself, then don't waste your time doing it,"" she says. ""Because you have to remember this is going to be your life and you don't want to spend the only life that you have being miserable.""Making every moment count is a part of that, she says. ""I think every day counts, whether it's something little that you do every day, it's a chance to improve. The sun goes up and down every day and you want to make sure you make the most of the time that matters in between."""

The first round of one of the PGA Tour's marquee events was initially delayed by over an hour due to over an inch of rain falling overnight at TPC Sawgrass, Florida. And then later in the day, play was delayed by four hours and 14 minutes after thunderstorms rolled into the area. The delays and an early finish because of darkness meant that more than half of the field were unable to finish their opening rounds. Fleetwood, who has gone two years since his last victory, was one of those who was able to finish, shooting a six-under-par 66 to lead with Hoge. Read MoreFleetwood plays his third shot on the par four, 14th hole during the first round of the Players Championship.The 31-year-old returned from the delay with three straight birdies to really kickstart his round, saying that he was ""quite happy when the delay came"" as it allowed him to practice certain putts. ""I'm chuffed to be in on that score,"" Fleetwood said. ""I felt like I drove the ball well aside from a couple, and I felt like I chipped and putted great. For sure, that was the most I could have got out of the round. So days like that are very, very pleasing.""Six players from the early side of the draw did not finish, meaning they will return early on Friday morning to play just one or two holes before getting the rest of the day off while 12 players never even hit a tee shot.England's Ian Poulter was one of those who did finish, but he had to inject some speed to complete his 18 holes. With the horn looming to halt play for darkness, the 46-year-old sped through the final two holes in attempt to avoid an early start. By ruling, a group can finish any hole that they have started before the horn sounded. Poulter subsequently sprinted round the lake on the famous par-three 17th hole to cheers from the crowd, claiming a rapid birdie before running to the 18th tee box. Having alerted the group in front of him -- who moved to the side of the fairway -- he smashed his drive on the final hole way to the right, salvaging a par and finishing with a one-over 73. It's not the first time Poulter has done this at TPC Sawgrass, as the Englishman sprinted round the 17th in 2011.

And with more poor weather scheduled for Friday, he isn't predicting taking to the course. ""I'm very excited, I don't think we're going to play tomorrow,"" Perez said. ""It's nice, it's nice. Now I don't have to do s**t tomorrow. It's perfect.""Perez added: ""Poulter just said I'm running. He's done it before. God bless him ...

It's a day-to-day situation ... without answers, it is difficult to plan.""We go day by day and we hope the new owner will come and want to continue the legacy on the pitch because we are a team that wants to win and do our best,"" Cech added.Graffiti is seen on boarding at a construction site next to Chelsea Football Club at Stamford Bridge on March 11.'I'll stick to the football'The tumultuous context around the club's ownership was made all the more intriguing by the circumstances of the opposition, Newcastle United, who in October were taken over by a Saudi-Arabian backed consortium.The three-party consortium includes the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF), a sovereign wealth fund chaired by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Its involvement in the takeover of Newcastle has been a long-running saga in English football, during which time Saudi Arabia's human rights record -- including the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi -- has come under scrutiny.Their club became the richest in the world. But these fans are worried at what it means for Newcastle's soulSaudi Arabia executed 81 men on Saturday, authorities said, in the biggest mass execution in decades, according to Reuters.A Saudi Arabia flag -- as well as a Ukrainian flag -- was visible in the Newcastle supporters' away end. Asked about the executions after the game, Newcastle manager Eddie Howe told reporters he would ""stick to the football.""""I'm still bitterly disappointed about the result,"" Howe added.Havertz, the controversial heroMuch of his disappointment stemmed from Havertz's role as matchwinner, with Howe alleging that the German should not have been on the pitch to score his late decider.Havertz was booked for an elbow on Newcastle defender Dan Burn during the first-half, with the video assistant referee (VAR) not deeming it serious enough to be a red card.Having frustrated the hosts for the majority of the game, more perceived injustice followed for Newcastle in the second-half when Chelsea's Trevoh Chalobah looked to have fouled Jacob Murphy in the box, yet no penalty was given.Havertz's late goal took the points, but Newcastle manager Eddie Howe believed the German should not have been on the pitch.""Dan [Burn] thinks it's a clear red,"" Howe told reporters. ""It could've been given. ""The one I'm most disappointed with and don't understand how it's not been given is the penalty ... Jacob Murphy's had his shirt ripped off his back near enough.""It is said that football is often a cruel mistress, and for Newcastle, she stayed true to script as Havertz -- moments from the end of regulation time -- plucked Jorginho's superb pass out of the sky with a deft touch before poking past Magpies keeper Martin Dubravka.Cue delirium at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea, despite all the noise, secured a fifth consecutive win in the Premier League."

He checked his phone and saw five missed calls from his parents as the invasion became a reality.Oleksandr Usyk: 'My soul belongs to the Lord and my body and my honor to my country,' says heavyweight champion after joining Ukrainian defense battalion""That's when I start panicking,"" said Djau Codjovi, who was born in Spain to parents from the Ivory Coast and Guinea-Bissau.""I was like 'oh my days.' I opened my suitcase and put everything inside,"" he said.""And then I went outside to see what's going on and all my teammates were saying they invaded Ukraine, it is actually happening.""Earlier in February during a training camp in Turkey, Djau Codjovi said his parents, Amadeo and Sika Marie, as well as agent Soriebah Kajue, had pleaded with him not to go back to Ukraine with the drums of war beating louder.Djau Codjovi says Vorskla played down the threat or war -- describing them as Russian ""propaganda"" -- and assured the players that they had backup plans should they need to evacuate them at short notice. At the time, much of the world wasn't sure of Russian President Vladimir Putin's intentions, even as he massed troops at the border.As a young player with hopes of breaking into the first team ahead of the Ukrainian Premier League's resumption on February 25, Djau Codjovi opted to return in pursuit of his soccer dream.That dream quickly turned into a nightmare.Amilcar Djau Codjovi had been playing for Vorskla Poltava in Ukraine prior to the Russian invasion. READ: Ukraine and Benfica star tears up after receiving standing ovation'Everyone for themselves'When the Russians started attacking Kharkiv, which is 160 kilometers away from Vorskla, Djau Codjovi says he was told by his coach Iurii Maksymov that he should wait at the club's accommodation while the player's travel plans were being arranged.But Djau Codjovi soon realized that he was on his own after he said some of his teammates, who were already plotting their way out, told him it was a case of ""everyone for themselves.""CNN has contacted Vorskla and Maksymov for comment on Djau Codjovi's version of events but did not get a response at the time of publishing.Loaded with water, chips and chocolate for the 1,500 kilometer journey, a group of 10 players and their families, including a toddler, hit the road unsure of what would await them.After initially deciding to drive to the Polish border, they were informed of long lines of traffic and waiting times, so the traveling party headed towards the Hungarian border.Petrol was scarce, the roads were full of potholes, and travel at night was challenging as explosions and gunfire could be heard.Then disaster struck when one of the cars had a flat tire.JUST WATCHEDUkrainian tennis star Elina Svitolina speaks out against Russian invasionReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUkrainian tennis star Elina Svitolina speaks out against Russian invasion 03:21""We had to stop,"" Djau Codjovi said.

We are obviously happy that we are finally here, but we got there and they say, 'no, you can't go through walking, you need a vehicle,"" said Djau Codjovi, with frustration etched across his face.""We were literally stranded outside in the cold, it was freezing. It's like a 20-second ride ... some people were actually bringing cars there and empty minivans but charging people ... $1,600 per person. At that point I just gave up.""READ: Ukraine to send full delegation to 2022 Winter ParalympicsDjau-Codjovi managed to safely escape Ukraine via Hungary.

It tasted so nice,"" he said.Tennis star Elina Svitolina says all prize money she wins at Monterrey Open will go to Ukrainian armyHowever, that meal didn't compare to his mom's home cooking on his arrival in Manchester, England, when she made him his favorite Ivorian food four long days after he embarked on his great escape.""I just felt good, but more for my family because I know my parents were not sleeping,"" he added.Djau Codjovi has since vowed he won't return to Ukraine.""Even when the war finishes, I don't think football will be the same. To recover from a war doesn't take a couple of years, it takes a lot of time,"" he said.Djau Codjovi's hopes of playing in European competition for Vorskla Poltava might be over, but he's keen to restart his career in Spain or England -- given the opportunity.He was born in Spain and lived there for 15 years before his family relocated to England. He had trials with Premier League teams Liverpool and Aston Villa, before eventually joining Morecambe where he made the first-team bench several times as a 16-year-old, though he ultimately failed to earn a pro deal there.He joined Vorskla Poltava in the summer of 2020 but sustained a knee injury which meant he had to return to the UK for treatment. However, this season saw him break into the first team, making seven appearances before the winter break and scoring a memorable goal against Lviv.If his dream of being a top soccer player is deferred for now, the 20-year-old has plenty of time on his side. More importantly, he's alive."

The $518,000 ball featured during the Buccaneers' home playoff loss to the Los Angeles Rams on January 23.

We are ecstatic that he decided to continue playing and working toward winning another championship,"" Arians said in a statement.Brady has won seven Super Bowl titles -- six with the New England Patriots and one with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers -- and is the NFL's all-time leader in passing yards (84,520), touchdown passes (624), completions (7,263), regular season wins (243), playoff wins (35) and Super Bowl MVPs (five). He has also played in and won more regular-season games in his career than any other quarterback.Selected 199th overall in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL draft by the Patriots, Brady played 20 seasons in Foxborough before leaving New England as a free agent after the 2020 season and signed with the Bucs, where he led the team to a Super Bowl win in his first season there."

People keep talking about (whether) we're talking ourselves down or not but it's a bit different this year.""Mercedes's rivals have taken such declarations with some scepticism in the past.Last year Mercedes had a troubled pre-season, completing the fewest laps of any team, but Hamilton still won the opening race in Bahrain.Max Verstappen wins first F1 world title after dramatic Abu Dhabi Grand Prix endingIn 2019, Mercedes had looked up to half a second off Ferrari's pace in testing and then finished one-two in Melbourne.This season has radically revised rules and Hamilton, the sport's most successful driver of all time with a record 103 wins, said it felt different.""I think we have far bigger challenges this time,"" he said. ""It will take a little bit longer. From what I'm told, we have a considerable amount of pace to find.""AlphaTauri's Pierre Gasly, who followed the Mercedes closely on Saturday and observed Hamilton's struggles with the car, was prepared to agree.""I think they do have some work to be fighting right at the top, but it's only testing,"" said the Frenchman."

In his first few years in the sport, skiing with friends, he attracted a lot of attention. ""Being the only Black representative in the group, even though I am only half-Black and being of Jamaican heritage, people kept throwing jokes, sideways jokes at me about 'Cool Runnings,' the Jamaican bobsled team and, 'You should go to the Olympics,'"" Alexander told CNN Sport. Benjamin Alexander represented Jamaica in alpine skiing -- a first for the island nation.Although the Summer Games are often heralded as a melting pot -- 11,417 athletes from 206 countries and regions across 33 sports participated in Tokyo 2020 -- the Winter Games are nowhere near as diverse, with 91 delegations taking part at Beijing 2022. That's five times more than the number of teams represented in the first Winter Games in Chamonix, France in 1924. Read MoreBut athletes from Africa, South Asia, as well as those from smaller island nations still find themselves struggling to qualify for competition in the Winter Olympics due to warmer climates, the prohibitively high cost of equipment, lack of infrastructure and limited opportunities to practice and compete.  And one athlete and his coaches that CNN interviewed for this story warn that continental quota systems that allowed countries and regions with smaller Winter Olympic delegations the opportunity to establish and expand in sliding sports in PyeongChang 2018 were scrapped ahead of Beijing, with a knock-on effect on African countries.  A push for diversity, with limited success More countries are making their debut in the Winter Olympics.Saudi Arabia and Haiti each sent an alpine skier to Beijing while Nigeria and Eritrea competed in the Winter Games for the second time after making their debut in PyeongChang 2018. In fact, eight African countries sent athletes to South Korea four years ago, a record number. But just five African countries participated in this year's Games, where the medal tables were dominated by athletes from Europe, North America and Asia. European and North American dominance in the Winter Games can in part be explained by the fact that their climates, where ice and snow are more plentiful, lend themselves to winter sports.  But climate isn't the only factor affecting Olympic participation -- when it comes to representation at the Winter Games, there is also a huge gap between wealthier and poorer nations. At PyeongChang 2018, no athlete from Africa, Central or South America won a medal, while Norway -- one of the world's wealthiest countries but with a population of just about five million -- topped the medal table as it did at Beijing 2022.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) says it ""aims to make success at the Games achievable by everyone.""  It allocates a ""substantial portion"" of profit from the Games to athletes and coaches through individual National Olympic Committees (NOCs) as part of the Olympic Solidarity Plan to help ""athletes and coaches from countries with the greatest financial need."" Some 429 athletes from 80 NOCs were awarded scholarships ahead of Beijing to ""support qualification efforts,"" according to the IOC. But European athletes nabbed nearly 69% of 429 scholarships awarded by the IOC before the Beijing Games. African athletes took home around 4% of those 429 scholarships. Only NOCs ""whose athletes had a proven winter sports track record"" had access to the program, the IOC said. Meanwhile, 236 athletes (139 men and 97 women) who received these individual athlete scholarships eventually qualified to take part in the Games.  Athletes in Europe benefited the most from these scholarships, receiving more than $5 million. Athletes in Asia received $955,003, the Americas $944,917, Oceania got $441,000 and Africa $177,000. 


European athletes received most funding from Olympic scholarships ahead of 2022 Winter Games
Of the $7.5 million in scholarships issued ahead of Beijing 2022, athletes from Europe collectively received more than $5 million while athletes in Africa received just $177,000, according to the 2017-2020 IOC Olympic Solidarity report.

Scholarships make up just a part of Olympic Solidarity assistance programs designed jointly by the IOC and NOCs, which also direct funds -- derived from Olympic revenue -- towards training of coaches, sports administrators and promoting the Olympic values, according to the IOC.  CNN has reached out to the IOC for a further breakdown of funding. Racial diversity not reflected On a national level, the composition of delegations often isn't very racially diverse. ""There have been Black medalists from the US and Canada and from Germany. I don't know of any other Black medalists except for those three countries,"" Olympic historian Bill Mallon told CNN Sport. Black athletes have proven crucial to Team USA's Olympic and Paralympic success in the Summer Games.  But even as Black athletes won medals at Beijing -- speedskater Erin Jackson brought home gold, while bobsledder Elana Meyers Taylor became the most decorated Black athlete in Winter Olympics history -- White athletes still made up the majority of Team USA at the Games this year. Prior to Beijing, the US has only had around 25 Black representatives on all of their various Winter Olympic teams, with over half of them in bobsledding, according to Mallon.  In 1988, Debi Thomas became Team USA's first Black Olympic Winter medalist, winning bronze in the ladies' figure skating competition, and Vonetta Flowers became the first Black athlete to ever win gold in the Winter Games, when she drove to victory in the two-woman bobsled with Jill Bakken in 2002. Hockey player Jarome Iginla became the first Black man to win gold at the same Games when Canada triumphed over the US. Four years later, speedskater Shani Davis became the first African American athlete to win an individual gold medal in Turin, Italy. Overall, there have been a relatively small number of Black figure skaters, and they have rarely excelled at the Olympic level. Though she demonstrated technical excellence in her routines, Black French skater Surya Bonaly never won an Olympic medal.  Surya Bonaly of France performs a backflip in her free skate routine in the women's Olympic figure skating in Nagano on February 20, 1998.Bonaly performed a one-bladed backflip at the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics -- an illegal move that was perceived as an act of defiance to the judges -- which she landed on one foot.  That move is still illegal and has never been tried since in an Olympic competition.""They want to keep the girls pretty, in a special way,"" Bonaly told CNN Sport as she reflected on her career. Though now, according to Bonaly, ""people are changing and trying to challenge themselves, and try to have more personality in their own style. And that's good. And it's more accepted.""Bonaly added: ""Now, back then ... you only came from one mold, one way.""Black athletes are now prevalent in sliding sports: African American women comprise a majority of America's Olympic bobsled team. Nathan Chen skates during the Men's Free Skating program at Beijing 2022 on February 10, 2022.Asian American athletes, including figure skater Nathan Chen and snowboarder Chloe Kim, have also had a commanding presence at this year's Games. Four of the six Team USA singles figure skaters were Asian American: Karen Chen, Nathan Chen, Alysa Liu and Vincent Zhou. Madison Chock competed in the ice dancing event, while Abby Roque was the first Indigenous women's hockey player in US team history.  Pay to play economics Experts say that economics -- not just talent -- plays a huge part in whether athletes are able to participate in the Olympics. ""That notion of economics is very key because we're looking at sports such as skiing, bobsledding, figure skating -- and that equipment alone costs so much,"" Akilah Carter-Francique, executive director of the Institute for the Study of Sport, Society and Social Change at San Jose State University told CNN Sport.  ""Pay to play is not accessible to anyone but people with money,"" Shireen Ahmed, senior contributor with CBC Sports, told CNN. ""It becomes not just a racialized issue, it's a class issue, and those two things go hand-in-hand. Not everybody's going to be a working-class hero,"" she said.  With stories of parents remortgaging their homes, working long hours and reducing expenses to facilitate their children's Olympic dreams, it comes as no surprise that financial barriers in winter sports can be prohibitive.  Ghana's first skeleton Olympian Akwasi Frimpong told CNN Sport that competing at an elite level costs around $250,000 a year, which would pay for a dedicated full-time sliding coach, a push coach, a strength and conditioning coach, physical therapist, a mechanic, sliding equipment, hotel, air travel, ground transportation and food.  ""This does not include also having a family and a mortgage to pay,"" he said, adding that sliding sports athletes would expect to pay $80,000 to compete in smaller, non-Olympic events, outside of the Olympic season. Jamaica's first Olympic alpine skier Alexander told CNN: ""I'm competing with people that have been skiing since the age of two, ski racing since the age of four, and their parents have put $50,000 a year into their improvements while they were young.""  ""And now, their national ski federation or local club is putting in $150,000-250,000 a year for their advancement,"" he said. In 2020, 58% of nearly 500 athletes surveyed by the athletes' rights group Global Athlete said they did not consider themselves financially stable. The athletes who participated in the survey hailed from 48 countries. 44% were actively competing with sport as their primary profession and 31% of the athletes were Olympians.  Shiva Keshavan, a six-time Olympian and India's only Olympic competitor in luge in the 2018 Winter Games told CNN that European delegations, which have a better system of recruitment and employment for athletes, dominate Olympic winter sports.  ""Athletes that come from developing sport nations generally have more of a challenge because you don't have the systems in place that enable a successful career. ""Often, athletes are having to deal with training with less, with worse equipment or having to do their own logistics and, sometimes, without a coach,"" he added. Many elite skiers, snowboarders and ice skaters take expensive private lessons, hire coaches or attend private schools to facilitate their training as they're growing up.  Bode Miller -- the most decorated US Olympic skier, with one gold, three silver and two bronze medals -- attended Carrabassett Valley Academy in Maine on a scholarship and said in 2021 that he ""wouldn't have been able to go if not for generous people in my small town of Franconia."" Parents with means can expect to pay as much as $64,050 to send their children to the academy, which boasts that it has ""earned more Olympic medals for skiing and snowboarding than some small countries.""  Privately educated athletes constituted 30.3% of athletes who participated in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Public Health.The study analyzed sociodemographic data for all athletes representing Canada, the US, Great Britain and Australia in Sochi. 94.9% of winter athletes were White.  ""If your parents ski, almost certainly, you will ski,"" Alexander told CNN. ""If we look at minorities in America or in England, most of them are first- or second-generation immigrants, so they don't have as much disposable income as their White counterparts,"" Alexander said. Adding that he doesn't think"" winter sports are racist at all,"" Alexander says diversity will continue to grow in winter sports. ""I just think that as more and more minorities get equal treatment, get equal pay, and as more and more minorities spread out from urban centers by virtue of technology ... then I believe the tide will turn."" In a statement sent to CNN, the IOC said it ""fully supports diversity and inclusion in the Olympic Games, as well as clear and fair qualification systems that apply equally to all athletes wishing to qualify for the Olympic Games.""  ""We have to strike a balance between attracting the best athletes in the world and universality,"" it added.""Some sports in all reality are more accessible,"" James Macleod, IOC Director of Olympic Solidarity and National Olympic Committees Relations told CNN Sport, referencing running the 100 meters.  ""But you can't sail a sailing boat tomorrow, unless you've got access to one, or ride a horse or ski down a mountain. And there's factors in that that are socio-economic, that are political, that are climate driven,"" he said.  ""And that's not something that us at the IOC are going to change.  ""All sports have different levels of access,"" Macleod said, adding that this is something the international federations of each sport ""tries to look at."" The IOC said that qualification systems are developed and put in place by international federations ""to ensure a fair and credible process for athletes to qualify for the Olympic Games according to their sports' structures and priorities.""  ""Collectively, the qualification systems allow diversity at the Olympic Winter Games, however, this is not necessarily reflected at each discipline level in every sport,"" it added.  Infrastructure challenges Winter sports infrastructure is well established in some parts of Asia -- notably in Japan, South Korea and China. But it remains an ""unexplored market"" in India, Keshavan said.  ""For India, a country that has a lot more natural resources for winter sports, compared to China, or Japan or Korea because of the Himalayan Mountain range, it is a big opportunity.  ""We don't really have the kind of infrastructure: ski resorts, big sports facilities,"" he said. This year, a single athlete, Mohammad Arif Khan, represented India's nearly 1.4 billion people, having qualified in the slalom and giant slalom events.  Khan finished 45th in the giant slalom. India has never won a medal at the Winter Games and does not have a prominent winter sports federation, Keshavan told CNN Sport. Shiva Keshavan of India reacts following run 3 during the Luge Men's Singles on day two of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games. ""Of course, it is more difficult for athletes from these countries to train at an elite level because you need access to a certain standard of ice quality which is maintained. You need to have modified slopes, you need to have certain equipment,"" he said. ""Skiers from India and Pakistan, even all over Southeast Asia, Oceania, have to travel and go to Europe for training,"" he added. Athletes and politicians alike are hopeful that South Asia will become a winter sports destination: Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan recently expressed optimism that the northern city of Skardu would turn into a world winter sports destination in years to come. Frimpong, the Olympian from Ghana, told CNN that people don't necessarily see the lack of diversity in winter sports as illogical because many countries get little to no snow. ""But that doesn't matter,"" he explained. For six months of the year, skeleton athletes can train in pushing the sled, he said.""You can do most of that in your own country in Africa. We do track and field training, we do weightlifting, I'll be able to test for three, four months at a time in areas where there are tracks. It's not like it's impossible,"" he said. ""Infrastructure is not something that the IOC invests in,"" Macleod told CNN adding: ""That's within the remit of the national government."" ""Often, when we have this discussion about African participation and in winter sports, the reality is that within African countries, there is not the infrastructure,"" Macleod said. ""We as the IOC are not going to start building ice rinks across Africa -- that is not something that is in our mission. That has to come through the national governments, but the programs that we offer are grassroots and talent identification programs,"" he added. ""Each of the 206 National Olympic Committees in the world has different priorities. When a NOC looks at our programs or looks at their own development opportunities, they will say, 'Actually, we're not going to invest in winter sports because that's not a priority for us.'""'We're going to invest in athletics, rowing or whatever.' And they will always have to make that choice of where they're going to put their funding and what programs from our side they're going to apply for,"" he said. ""We put at the disposal of our stakeholders -- whether it's NOCs or the IFs (international federations) -- a range of opportunities, but we are not going to go into a country and say this has got to be your priority. They are going to decide on their own priorities,"" he said. Representation matters Carter-Francique told CNN that while the Olympics is billed as an opportunity for all to participate, this is not reflected in delegations' final offerings.  ""For many, the key to involvement in a particular sport is seeing yourself,"" she added.  In winter sports especially, there are a lack of development programs to encourage underserved communities to participate, said Carter-Francique. ""If you don't see yourself as a representative in that space, the likelihood that you would push to try to enter a space and be the first or be the only is one that not many people would do,"" she added. Some sports, like soccer, basketball, and even tennis, are more accessible because training facilities and equipment can be cheaper, Carter-Francique said. ""But the opportunity to access a ski resort, a figure skating rink, a bobsled facility -- and have the bobsled -- is very limited in general,"" she added. Ahmed also points to an absence of Muslim representation in the Winter Olympics, which is contrary to the Summer Games.  ""We see a general trend in ... Summer Games -- you've got Central Asian athletes doing a lot of weightlifting. You've got Middle Eastern women doing judo, judokas, or karate, artists and athletes,"" Ahmed added. Ditching continental quotas a step backwards for inclusion Frimpong and Nigeria's Simidele Adeagbo became the first African skeleton racers to compete at PyeongChang 2018 following the introduction of the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation's (IBSF) continental quota system.  But the IBSF and the IOC opted to revoke the continental quota for the Beijing Games -- something coaches had warned would deliver a ""crushing blow"" to African athletes hoping to participate in winter sports.  Coaches Brian McDonald and Zach Lund warned the IOC in a December 30, 2021 email seen by CNN that ""inequitable quotas that didn't take into account the massive hurdles African athletes must clear in order to train and aspire to be Winter Olympians.  ""The dream of so many Africans to watch and be inspired by fellow Africans competing in the Winter Olympic Games will bear long-lasting fruit for Olympic sport,"" they wrote.  Akwasi Frimpong of Ghana starts his men's skeleton training session at the Olympic Sliding Centre, during the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games on February 12, 2018.Simidele Adeagbo of Nigeria reacts as she finishes a run during the Women's Skeleton on day eight of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games on February 17, 2018.""An exclusion will be a crushing blow to African athletes who worked so hard and who dared to dream what once seemed impossible,"" they added in the email. The quota for sliding sports was removed ahead of Beijing -- a decision which directly affected Frimpong. ""Giving an athlete a quota place, which is not according to the qualification criteria, would consequently imply the exclusion of another athlete qualified in the current qualification system,"" an IOC representative told Frimpong's coaches in a January 12 email seen by CNN. ""I qualified as Ghana's first skeleton Olympian, and the first Black male skeleton athlete ever in history at the Olympic Games, both in the world as well as for Africa,"" Frimpong told CNN.  Frimpong was 99th in world rankings ahead of PyeongChang and qualified through the quota system.  ""Now, I am 36 points higher than I was, which means I am 63 on the world ranking. I needed to be in the top 60 which is the prerequisite to qualify for this Olympic Games -- to be able to qualify outright,"" he told CNN. On December 29, hoping to compete in three final races and obtain enough points to make the top 60, Frimpong tested positive for Covid-19 and was unable to compete. He did not qualify for the Winter Olympics. Frimpong said his pre-Covid rating meant ""I could possibly almost qualify outright, meaning that I am as good -- maybe not as good as the gold medalist or the top 10 Europeans or whatsoever -- but I'm good enough to be in the world class sport that is dominated by Europeans, westerners.""  Frimpong said his coaches emailed the IOC asking them to reinstate a continental quota for all winter sports ""for qualified African athletes who can safely compete."" ""We're not asking them to take away a spot from any other nations, we're not asking them to give us a free way, or a free card.""But if there are African athletes in winter sports that are close to qualifying, which means they are competitive and qualified and can safely compete, that quota should be in place until there's enough African athletes,"" he added. In a statement sent to CNN, the IBSF confirmed that the continental quota spot was not included in the Olympic Qualification System for Beijing 2022.  ""To address Emerging Nations and their needs, the IBSF established a wider Development Program which focused as mentioned on Emerging Nations but equally on gender equity in supporting athletes on their qualification pathway to the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022,"" the organization said in a statement. No athlete representing an African NOC has ever won a medal. ""We were looking forward to seeing more and more Africans compete in 2022. And now it's less than half, or at least half of what it was in 2018, so it's disappointing. The message is clear that inclusiveness is not a priority,"" Frimpong added. But there is hope -- even if only for a select few athletes.American bobsledder Meyers Taylor's bronze in the two-woman bobsled on Saturday gave the 37-year-old her fifth Olympic medal as she surpassed Davis' four. Meyers Taylor is now the most decorated woman Olympic bobsledder ever.When asked about passing Davis' record saying, she said: ""That is overwhelming. It's so crazy to hear that stat and to know that I'm part of a legacy that's bigger than me. Hopefully, it just encourages more and more Black athletes to come out to winter sports and not just Black athletes, winter sports for everybody.""We want everybody to come out regardless of the color of your skin. We want winter sports to be for everybody, regardless of race, regardless of socio-economic class. I think the more diversity we have, the stronger our sport can be. ""So, hopefully, this is just the start of more and more people coming out and trying winter sports.""UPDATE: This story has been updated to reflect the IOC's most recent individual Olympic Solidarity scholarship data.CNN's Homero De La Fuente contributed reporting."

And as the Winter Olympics comes to an end, a new cookbook provides a glimpse into what makes top athletes tick.The Winning Recipes cookbook is the idea of the Purple Project, an organization that looks to support domestic abuse survivors, which has worked over the past year to create a gastronomic tome made up of the favorite recipes from some of the US' best Olympic athletes. ""The Purple Project reached out to me out of the blue,"" retired Olympic skier Noah Hoffman, who was invited to take part, told CNN Sport. Read More""At first, I thought, 'That's a little strange, I'm not a chef. I don't know if I can contribute to a cookbook.' ""But, of course, I love to cook. I think everybody loves to eat and I love to eat, and I have favorite recipes. ""I actually sat down with my partner and we came up with the recipe together and made it once or twice to make sure that we had it correct.""Hoffman's offering of 'Berry Dutch Baby' can be found in the breakfast section, but even he admits it's designed for someone with a very sweet tooth. The recipe, which involves fried frozen berries underneath a baked doughy pastry, was a favorite of Hoffman's during his career but only on the odd occasion. ""Certainly, only on days off,"" he said laughing. ""It's a little bit time intensive and maybe not the best training fuel, but a nice treat on a recovery day.""READ: Canada-born Humphries wins gold medal for US after ​filing harassment complaintTwo-time Olympian Anita Alvarez (R) unloading donations with the Purple Project.8,000 calories per day Hoffman retired from competitive skiing after the PyeongChang Games in 2018 but enjoyed a long career which involved two Winter Olympic Games.He specialized in endurance events and would push his body ""to the limit"" during training in order to reap the rewards come race day.Hoffman says he would consume food ""endlessly"" during training blocks. He even remembers sitting down to eat over one pound of pasta for lunch. ""There was a time in my early 20s, when I was still growing, that I was eating at least 8,000 calories a day. It's an incredible amount of food,"" he said, before remembering some of the tricks he used to boost the calorie intake.  Noah Hoffman: Former Olympic cross-country skier is 'scared' for athletes who speak out at Beijing 2022""So you cook a whole box of pasta and you eat it all in one sitting for lunch. It's just astounding.""I don't advise that for any young athlete, but I couldn't fill myself up. I was just eating constantly. It was wild.""Hoffman's eating habits changed slightly as he became more successful and he worked with a dietitian for much of his career. The US ski team employed nutritionists to help its athletes reach their optimal levels of fitness and Hoffman still looks after what he eats even after retiring from competitive skiing.

Like many have done since the pandemic, Hoffman wants to use his platform as an athlete to change society for the better. He confesses to not knowing much about domestic abuse rates prior to working on this initiative but says he's been ""humbled"" to learn more about the work the Purple Project is doing. According to the organization, nearly 20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the US, so the Purple Project looks to provide aid and support for emergency domestic violence shelters.""I do think the role of an athlete has changed, and I think that's kind of part of a societal change where politics seem to be a little more central and, unfortunately, a little more divided as a whole.""So I think that as that happens, athletes like everybody feel the need to speak out and really feel passionately and want to see the world a better place.""So athletes are really wanting to give back and are understanding that they have a lot of leverage and a lot of power to help organizations that they want to help.""So I was just really honored to be included in this project ... and getting to learn about the Purple Project and all the work that they do."""

Being so far out of their comfort zone, tackling a route that requires both mental and physical fortitude, provides Sabourin with an opportunity to reflect and work through the challenges in their life. In many ways, it's much more than just a sport for them -- it's a way of exploring identity which has helped them accept who they are. ""I think it's really hard to hide from the stress of climbing. When you go out, you're really choosing to be vulnerable,"" Sabourin tells CNN Sport.""You don't have to do that everywhere else in life.Read More""People are able to really find out how they do best when they're in stress and to learn better ways to respond to stress and to things like fear and insecurity."" Sabourin has recently released a film with Patagonia that explores their life as a non-binary climber, following Sabourin as they take on one of the hardest routes of their life in the sandstone canyons of northern Arizona. It provided Sabourin with a chance to speak about their journey and address what it means for them to be a trans climber in 2021.In tackling some dark periods of their life -- including battles with eating disorders, self-harm and sexual assault -- the film ""They/Them"" shows how Sabourin has learned to thrive in the climbing community. ""Making the film was hard in a lot of ways because, so often when we go through something hard and then come out on the other side, we want to just pretend that that didn't happen,"" they added.""So I really had to go back to parts of my story that maybe I didn't talk about with people in my life very often.

It may seem improbable now when you see photos of them hanging off the side of a rock face, but there was a time when they were too scared to use the three-meter slide at their local swimming pool. In truth, climbing wasn't something that came naturally, but sport always played a major role in their upbringing. They were a strong runner throughout their education but finally fell into climbing as a way of combining competition with their love of the outdoors. ""[Climbing] is very all-consuming,"" Sabourin said. ""Running, for example, it's like your mind can go anywhere and you can still run quite quickly.""And that's one of my favorite things about running is having a place where I can just let my mind go, and climbing isn't really that way. ""When you're climbing, you have to have 100% of your attention on what you're doing. And that's really therapeutic in its own way.""

However, as their profile within the sport becomes more well-known, Sabourin has had to deal with online hate and microaggressions from within the community, such as people reacting angrily about using different pronouns. In the film, they describe how they were subject to online abuse after an interview with climbing magazine ""Rock and Ice"" was published. There are also times in normal life where Sabourin feels less safe than their non-trans friends. ""I guess that's really challenging, especially having a background of experiencing pretty extreme violence at a young age for my identity,"" they said. ""With the film, it definitely brings up that fear. I am putting myself out there in a really public way, and so it's definitely opening up to the potential for more of that to happen.""But [...] in all of those interactions, people didn't take the time to get to know me.""What I feel is really powerful about the film [...] is you kind of have to stay with me long enough to learn that I'm a human just like anyone else and that being trans is one aspect.

Sabourin is aware that they may become the face for the wider community as a result. At a time when trans people are facing scrutiny in both the sporting arena and in wider society, Sabourin says climbing has an opportunity to create a more inclusive framework that other sports can follow. ""I think it could be simpler than people believe,"" they said. ""They get so hung up in the political debates and the legislation.""If we look at the value of sports to people, as humans, and the reasons that we participate and we strip it down back to that human aspect, it's a lot simpler than we think it is.""Sabourin says the thought of being a role model feels similar to tackling climbing projects -- intimidating, but also inspiring -- and admits the thought of people looking up to them has made them become more honest in their personal life. The American has struggled with eating disorders since they were seven or eight years old and wants to trigger conversations about how it can affect both athletes and the trans community. Now in recovery, Sabourin has learned to adopt a healthier relationship with food and exercise and has realized the destructive ways in which they were using food to manage their transition.

""I've tried my best to be a combination of holding myself really accountable and being really firm with myself about taking steps every day, but also give myself some levity around it and not always feel like I'm beating my head against the wall,"" Sabourin said. ""I want people to have a role model that's someone who takes care of themselves, who lives a life that they think is meaningful.

In 2017, Nadhira Alharthy met the first Omani man to climb Everest.Khalid al-Siyabi had summited Everest seven years earlier. He was part of a group of pioneering Omanis who were telling their inspirational stories at an assembly hosted by the Ministry of Education, where Alharthy was working as the director of citizenship at the time.  That evening she made a pledge to replicate al-Siyabi's achievement, using his mentorship as guidance.""His story, it touched me,"" she tells CNN Sport. ""I was inspired to do something for myself [...] to challenge myself.""Building up her strengthRead MoreBefore training to climb the world's tallest mountain, Alharthy's workout routine extended to going to the gym a few times a week. She knew she had to dramatically change gears, beginning with strengthening her muscles and improving her resistance. With al-Siyabi's help, her training schedule developed into that of a fully-fledged endurance athlete, consisting of running, hiking, rock climbing, canyoning and caving. The physical preparation for Everest was challenging, but improving her mental stamina was even harder. ""Training the mind [...] it's harder than training our bodies,"" she says. In the two years leading up to the climb, the only other person who knew about Alharthy's ambition was al-Siyabi. ""We kept it as a secret for a long time,"" she says.She wasn't just building up her mental strength for Everest, but also working up the courage to tell her family: ""I was scared to tell them because I just decided to go to Everest without any experience.""The endurance athlete says she takes advantage of Oman's arid desert terrain. She recently visited Jabal Akhdar, part of the Al Hajar mountain range in Oman. 'I was very lucky'In 2019, two months before setting off for Nepal, Alharthy told her family about the expedition. ""They were very surprised and shocked because I never discussed it before. They refused the idea from the beginning. My mom was very stressed and worried about my safety,"" she says.Despite their reaction, she was determined to fulfil her ambition. She arrived in Kathmandu flanked by an all-Arab, all-female team -- including Mona Shahab from Saudi Arabia, and Joyce Azzam and Nelly Attar from Lebanon.She was in constant contact with al-Siyabi until her arrival at base camp, when their line of communication started to dwindle. Her mentor had recently been admitted to hospital after suffering a stroke. ""I started feeling worried about him. But I said, 'OK, he will make it, he's strong,'"" she says.A week later Alharthy received the devastating news that al-Siyabi had passed away at the age of 46. She was in shock: ""Losing him, it was the hardest time there when I was climbing.""In January 2021, Alharthy became the first Arab woman to summit Ama Dablam, Nepal. His death gave the expedition a new sense of purpose. Alharthy wasn't just climbing to fulfill her own ambition, she wanted to honor al-Siyabi's memory as well.  ""He was the only person who stood with me, he helped me,"" she says. ""I decided to do it not for myself and not only my country, he would also be part of [...] the climb.""After two months of trekking across snow capped mountains, she found herself atop Everest on May 23, exactly nine years to the day since al-Siyabi's summit. She commemorated her mentor by planting a piece of paper inscribed with his name on the crest of the mountain. The poetry of their story isn't lost on her, acknowledging that ""the first Omani man helped me to be the first Omani woman [to summit Everest]."" She says completing her first summit alongside three other Arab women was what crowned her triumph: ""I was very lucky to have them [...] it brought us all together.""Two years later, Alharthy's face still lights up when she revisits her memories of climbing Everest. ""It's not like when you buy something, when you try a new meal, when you go shopping,"" she says. ""It was a different type of happiness.""Ama DablamWhile participating in endurance sports, Alharthy has had the chance to connect with fellow mountaineers. In January, she became the first Arab woman to summit Ama Dablam (22,349 feet) -- a mountain south of Everest -- while climbing alongside Qatari mountaineer Fahad Badar. ""I was not planning to go to Ama Dablam from the beginning. Then one of our friends, Fahad [...] he messaged me that he was going,"" says Alharthy.""I told him, I'm not as afraid of climbing the mountain as I was afraid of the cold because it's winter season and that's very difficult.""

""I felt that I was prepared.""With an exposed ridge that requires vertical mixed climbing in rock, ice and snow, she acknowledges this was her most grueling trial yet. She says the technical know-how and full-body strength required to climb Ama Dablam surpassed Everest. ""There is no way for mistakes on Ama Dablam because it's like you are climbing a big wall. We had to be attached on safety ropes all the time,"" she adds. ""If we miss anything, it's very dangerous."" Over the past year, Alharthy hasn't had a chance to plan ahead for expeditions due to coronavirus-related travel restrictions. In the meantime, she's been taking advantage of Oman's arid desert terrain -- most recently visiting the country's epic Al Hoota Cave, which is over two million years old and has a total length of almost 2.8 miles. ""I want to use all the chances I have here in Oman to improve myself physically,"" she says.Her next goal is to climb one of the 14 mountain peaks across the world that stand taller than 8,000m, dubbed by NASA as the Eight Thousanders. Rock formations in the Al Hoota natural cave after it re-opened to the public for the first time in three years near the ancient city of Jizwa in Oman's northern Dakhiliya region on September 2016. Finding solidarity through faithCementing her status as a record-breaking mountaineer means that Alharthy has attracted waves of media attention over the past few years, but she was never searching for the spotlight. Even though she relishes the opportunity to develop her physicality and test her resilience, she says that the intense media scrutiny that comes with the job is emotionally draining. Her limits were tested after Everest. She was having trouble dealing with the emotional comedown of completing such a monumental feat and decided to stop training for a while. ""I was feeling depressed,"" she says. ""I felt this pressure on me, it was something I was not looking for."" Alharthy has since found solidarity through her faith. Alharthy says she hopes her story will inspire young Omanis to participate in endurance sports. 
Ahead of her expedition to Ama Dablam, she earned messages of support from her Muslim fans on social media, where she has now amassed over 16,000 followers. She sees their prayers as a form of protection. ""Our faith [...] it makes you stand up again. It gives you strength, it gives you power.""Her increased visibility online means that her family is now more accepting of her endeavors. But like any parent, her mother continues to agonize over the safety of her daughter. ""For them, it's something very exposed, it's something very unsafe. My mom, she's waiting for me to tell her that I will never climb again,"" she says. ""They support me to do what I want, but they are worried.""She continues to inspire confidence in other Muslim women, many of whom have been encouraged to participate in outdoor sports after reading about her story. ""When I started training, many women were reluctant to do outdoor sports, especially those who wear the hijab, but it's now becoming quite common,"" she recently told the Times. Her 32 nieces also embolden her to share her journey and highlight the power of female participation in sport. ""They are very strong, and they stand up for their rights,"" she says.Mount Ama Dablam, which peaks at 6,812 meters (22,349 feet), in the Everest region.'Believe in your dream'Alharthy says the main purpose of her journey is to practice author Todd Henry's mantra -- to figuratively ""die empty"" from sharing knowledge: ""I think that's what Khalid was doing with many Omanis."" ""I think it's a great story,"" she goes on to tell CNN. ""Even for the new generation, for the other girls and men, just to support each other, to help each other, not to hold knowledge for ourselves."" She hopes that by teaching others about her experience through her newly appointed role as the general manager's assistant for the Girl Guides of Oman, she can lift up a new generation of young Omani people to take up endurance sports.Alharthy is also learning from her peers. She references one of her Everest teammates, Arthur Muir, who was initially unable to finish his trek in 2019. However, in May of this year, he became the oldest American to climb the world's highest peak at age 75. ""He's very positive, [a] great personality, [an] inspiration for all of us,"" she says. ""Believe in yourself, believe in your dream and work hard.""Ultimately, she draws strength from staying committed to her faith and her Omani roots. ""I always wake up in the morning and say, 'Alhumdullilah, thank God I'm here [...] I reached my goal,"" she says."

As a child growing up in Slovenia, she'd regularly be found racing up trees or scaling the door frames in her house, but it was on the climbing wall where she felt most at home and where her talent eventually shone through. Yet despite being one of the favorites to win gold at this year's Tokyo Olympics, Garnbret's career didn't get off to the start you might expect. She came last in her category in her first competition as a child but says she loved the sport too much to care at that stage. ""People always ask me if I was ever comparing myself to other kids, I was actually not,"" Garnbret, who recently scaled Europe's tallest chimney, tells CNN Sport. Read More""I was just enjoying myself on the wall and I was just climbing, trying to push my limits. I never thought to myself that I am better than everyone else. I just enjoyed climbing."" After a couple of years of practice and hard work, Garnbret quickly emerged as one of the best climbers in her country. Her world-class ability then became evident as she entered international competitions and started winning them consistently. She has gone on to win multiple World Cup events and has her eyes firmly on the postponed Tokyo Games which are set to finally go ahead this summer, which will see sport climbing make its Olympic debut. READ: Trailblazing climber Sasha DiGiulian was told 'little girls don't belong.' Slovenia's Janja Garnbret says she's looking forward to making her Olympic debut in Tokyo. 'I learned a lot about myself'The 22-year-old says the initial postponement gave her more time to work on her weaknesses but admitted the uncertainty around the pandemic was difficult to get her head around. She was fortunate enough to have a climbing wall at home, which she used to keep in good shape during her country's lockdown, but she was tested in ways she hadn't expected. ""I could train, but for me, it was hard because I was always the motivated person. I always had small goals and, of course, big goals and I never had fluctuations in motivation,"" she says.""I was always motivated but now it happened to me that I was motivated some days for training, some days not because every competition was postponed. I didn't know myself like that.""It was just something different and I learned a lot about myself, but I got used to the situation quite quickly.""Organizers remain insistent that the Games will go ahead this year, but there is still an element of doubt that the pandemic could scupper plans once again. Garnbret is trying to stay positive and is optimistic she'll make her Olympic debut in 2021, despite the situation seemingly changing every week.""I think Covid last year was just, of course, something new for us and we didn't know what to expect, how to deal with it,"" she adds.""But we came prepared into this year with all safety precautions and everything. It's still not a hundred percent, I completely understand that, but I will do my best and I will keep preparing for the Olympics.""READ: The climbers aiming to boost diversity in the sport JUST WATCHEDClimbing Europe's tallest chimneyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHClimbing Europe's tallest chimney 02:59Driving four hours a dayShould sport climbing make its debut at this year's Olympics, the competition will be run across three disciplines, each with their own techniques and format.Bouldering involves navigating as many fixed routes as possible in four minutes on a four-meter high wall with no safety ropes. Lead climbing requires athletes to climb as high as possible on a 15-meter plus wall in six minutes using safety ropes, without reclimbs. Speed climbing has two climbers ascend a parallel route at the same time on a 15-meter wall set at 95 degrees -- sometimes doing so in under 8 seconds. Combined results will determine medalists.Garnbret says speed climbing is by far her weakest discipline but has a thorough training schedule in place to improve every aspect of her performance. She trains six days a week, splitting her time between gym work, speed climbing and her usual wall training. Due to a lack of centralized facilities in Slovenia, Garnbret often drives up to four hours a day to attend all her sessions. It's a regime that requires determination, passion and a tireless work ethic but winning a gold medal would make it all worthwhile. ""I definitely know that every girl will take that extra year to their benefit,"" she says. ""I know every girl has her eyes set on the gold.""""I can't say that I will win the gold because I know everyone will be 100% prepared for that.

READ: Emily Harrington on her historic El Capitan climbGarnbret says the global pandemic initally knocked her motivation. Promoting healthy climbing While other athletes will be backed by wealthy sponsors and a team of sport scientists at this year's Olympics, Garnbret knows climbing is not quite at that level.The Slovenian hopes the opportunity to compete in front of a global audience will go some way towards changing that. ""I think it will be really beneficial to climbing because climbing is still a young sport. It's super young,"" she says. ""So it's definitely a huge playground for everyone, for sponsors, for some non-endemic sponsors that are still yet to come into our sport. That's definitely something huge."" Due to her success, Garnbret is already a role model to young climbers across the world, and she hopes she can drive the charge for better facilities in her own country. She also wants to boost a healthy image of the sport, which she says is more important than anything.Garnbret says the demands of climbing have led to youngsters, especially girls, trying to get lighter. This has, she says, sometimes led to people developing eating disorders in the bid for better results. She now wants to use her platform to show the next generation of climbers that maintaining a healthy lifestyle can translate into success.""I just want to set a good example in that you don't need to lose extra weight to be successful,"" she says. ""I definitely feel responsible for our sport. I just want to represent climbing as a fun sport, that it's always fun, you have to just climb up and enjoy yourself."" She continues: ""I remember I fell in love [...] the first time that I tried climbing because it felt so weightless, and it was just me and the wall. I remember that I was the only kid who stayed on the wall and didn't want to come off."""

That was the most special moment ever,"" Stoltman recently told CNN Sport after his remarkable victory in Sacramento, California back in June -- a victory made even more remarkable when you consider his extraordinary and unlikely path to victory. Stoltman has autism, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, often presented in restricted, repetitive patterns. ""[Growing up] I didn't have a clue that I was doing anything wrong,"" Stoltman recalls. ""All my behaviors and the stuff I was doing, like in the house, out of the house, to my parents, siblings, etc., I thought was normal.""I thought the other kids, doing different things, were the ones that were in the wrong.""As Stoltman became a teenager, his social issues intensified, until ""something just clicked in my brain"" and he decided to tell his closest friends at school.""I stood up and took my seven or eight best mates into a room and said, 'Look, I have autism.'""And they said, ""Look, there's no problem at all. We're still going to like you for who you are.'""And that day is when a weight lifted off my shoulders and I felt normal. Like a normal member of society.

So I went to my local gym and hated every single minute of it. I didn't like the people staring at me. But I kept going and kept on pushing myself and Luke kept on pushing me.""I knew he was obviously the best in the country, so I was just always wanting to try to get close to him. He was a bigger brother. I was just trying to pip at him, bite at him at every session.""Stoltman may have been skinny, but he wasn't small. And at six foot, eight inches, the young Scotsman had a prodigious appetite, which soon became key for his new found way of life given the need to 'bulk up.'""Even when I was a younger kid, I was taking four or five sandwiches to school for lunch.

And as he began honing his focus on his ever-increasing strength, Stoltman was finding his autism was proving to be a valuable asset. ""Having autism and [going to] the gym goes hand-in-hand,"" reflects Stoltman. ""When you're in the gym, you need a routine. And obviously, when I found 'Strongman,' it's all routine.

Read More""I'm five foot 10, I was 127 pounds and my body was just totally depleted and in really bad shape, and I needed to get back to my body.

He says that his testosterone levels were always ""clinically low"" as a runner, with natural remedies making no difference.

Rather than testing himself over the 26.2 miles of a marathon, he will take on unique challenges combining strength and endurance. Last month, for example, he took on a wood chop/water carry challenge. That involved splitting a cord of wood and running 6.3 miles to the bottom of the Grand Canyon, then 6.3 miles and 5,000 feet of elevation back up while carrying a 62-pound water jug in each hand.

Hall says of the feat. ""Even though you're trained, you're prepared, when you get in that moment it's a scary place.""Hall plans to take on unique challenges combining strength and endurance.He's now mulling his next challenge. One goal is to try and complete a 500-pound deadlift and mile run in under five minutes (he got 5:28 for his first attempt), and another is something that involves ""covering a good amount of distance with a heavy weight.""However, he's hasn't entirely forgotten his love for racing marathons. Coaching his wife Sara, who has run the second-fastest marathon time ever by an American woman, serves as a reminder of that. ""When I'm at Sara's races and she's super fit and she's warming up for marathons ... I just remember: Oh, how good it feels to be ripping it on the roads, feeling like a million bucks floating through it. There's no sensation like that,"" says Hall.He continues: ""I can think back to a whole bunch of moments when it was just me out in the woods on single-track trail, no one else around, no other sounds besides the wind blowing through the trees and having that same exact sensation: being in full flight, feeling like I'm floating along.""It's the sheer thrill of running that Hall tries to pass on to the runners he mentors, including his four daughters. ""I try to remind my girls: Hey, it's not about the performance, it's not about what place you are. Can you just fall in love with just the sensation of your body being in flight?"" says Hall. ""Because if you can fall in love with that sensation, you're going to get everything out of running that you want to get out of running. ""That's where the good stuff is at.

While he was ""super rigid"" with his schedule during his running career, he's learned to appreciate the value of constantly making adjustments to an athlete's training routine. ""I like to see myself as almost a chef,"" says Hall. ""When I'm writing the training, I have a 'recipe,' right?

I try to be really intuitive with my training.""Hall has also tweaked his diet over the past few years. As he did when he was a runner, he still eats a meal or a snack every three hours, but these days he's also upped his calorie intake.""I'm eating a ton of protein and I'm still eating a ton of carbs,"" he says.

Then his now-fiancee invited him on a run. The short jog triggered something in Balenger, who quickly saw the advantages of exercising as a way of coping with the stresses of his job and coming up with new ideas for his restaurant. Balenger gradually took on longer and tougher challenges; a half-marathon; a full marathon; and then found himself lining up on the start line for a grueling ultra-marathon.

But he always came back to running.Then, after a chance encounter with another man who had run across the US, Balenger started prepping for the biggest challenge of his life -- the transcontinental run.  ""I completed it in 75 days, so that averaged out to 43 miles a day. So I was putting in an ultra[-marathon] every day,"" he says, smiling. The main drive behind the project was raising awareness of better food choices.

""Here in the US especially, we have a really bad obesity problem and people are just really unhealthy,"" he says.""I think I hit it at a time where people were willing to acknowledge and accept that there was an issue, and therefore, they were open to conversations because they were seeing people all around them who are unhealthy and getting sick.""My thought was, 'I'm just going to show that I can do this on a plant based diet,' and along the way, I quickly realized not only could I do it, it was the reason I was able to do it.""

It felt like it was a cool thing to do,"" he says.""It was on the first day of spring and then it really resonated with me because that's where I finished my run across the United States, in Central Park.""[I was] really excited to have accomplished it and then your legs seize up and you get really stiff and then you get really tired, and luckily, you can pass out right afterward."" Balenger runs 10 miles every day in preparation for big challenges. Come rain or shine, he throws on his sneakers and goes outside. Consistency, he says, is key. While the thought of heading out for a run on a freezing morning might deter many, Balenger has always found a way to overcome the doubts in his mind.It's because running is more than just a physical challenge. It's his sanctuary. It's where he feels most at peace.  ""Running is the most spiritual aspect of my life,"" he says. ""It's where I go to be with myself and to explore who I am and the energies around me and who I want to be.""There's something that's very beautiful in the discomfort of it [...] feeling what some would call pain -- I guess it is like a dull low pain. ""But what comes out of that, you feel very alive. You feel every ounce of your being. Every step you feel your feet, you feel your legs, you feel your toes and there's something that is beautiful in that.""READ: Sam Holness hopes to use autism 'superpower' at Ironman World ChampionshipJUST WATCHEDUltra-runner breaks speed record after running 1,200 milesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUltra-runner breaks speed record after running 1,200 miles 03:10Spiritual connection Balenger's father died when he was very young, and although he enjoyed his childhood, he says he never had that male role model that so many take for granted. As he searched for a sense of himself, Balenger went chasing a party lifestyle. ""I expressed it in a lot of ways and a lot were probably not very healthy. Like being a guy that went out and drank a lot,"" he says.""Partying like that was kind of embodying what I thought it meant to be a man. It was living hard and that was kind of where this masculinity showed itself."" He says running helped him redefine masculinity, especially after watching athletes compete in the Hardrock Hundred Mile Endurance Run -- one of the hardest runs in the US. ""I was like: there's another version of a man that is just rough and tumble and got all of those qualities that I think I was trying to get from this bar scene,"" he says.""This is a way that is the healthier version of that. And so after seeing that, I wanted to embody that. And so that started this exploration of it and it's something that's still ongoing. ""I'm 36 years old, I'm still trying to understand what that is, and I do that through my running. It helps me to create an identity for myself that is healthy, and I think embodies a lot of what it means to be a man."" Balenger is currently tackling another mammoth challenge, in what he has dubbed  the ""Colorado Crush.""It involves running a marathon in June, a 50-mile run in July, and a 100-mile run in August. In between these, he will also bid to complete the Colorado trail -- which stretches for 500 miles -- and summit 58 peaks that are over 14,000 feet. During the challenge, he will be using neuroscience technology to see how it can optimize his sleep and help aid his recovery.""I think the more we run, the more we move our body, we push ourselves, the clearer and higher our frequency becomes,"" he says.""I think encouraging other people to do that will only better ourselves and better our communities and better the world. ""I know I am the best version of myself when I have a goal, when I'm moving my body, when I'm taking care of myself and I'm eating healthy. I want that for everyone.""You can follow Balenger's latest challenge on his Instagram account."

She is a mother of two who embodies power and strength.Rene Campbell has dedicated most of her life to sculpting her once diminutive frame into one that, she says, goes ""completely against what society thinks a woman should look like.""The bodybuilder's dedication has brought plenty of awards but building her dream body -- gaining over 85 pounds, going from a UK size 8 to 14 -- has had its challenges, too, both physically and mentally. ""I was very insecure about my body image, very insecure about myself as a person,"" Campbell, 44, tells CNN Sport from her home in Cornwall, UK, as she reflects on her motivation to transform herself. ""I was constantly feeling under pressure through the media that women needed to look a certain way.""""My bodybuilding journey made me realize that I needed to do things for myself,"" says Rene Campbell.Read More'A woman with muscle'""For quite some time I struggled with eating disorders because I was constantly trying to keep my weight really low, to appear skinny, like these women are on magazine covers,"" she says.Then, she attended a women's bodybuilding show and became intrigued by the way these seemingly confident women held themselves.Though Campbell ​says she loves the way she now looks, ​she says she is sometimes treated with cruelty, like when she has been asked to leave women's toilets. ""A lot of the time you are up against a lot of negativity. People set in an old mindset,"" Campbell adds. ""I was up against -- and still am -- a lot of criticism from people who don't understand why women would want to be muscular. But it just gave me a sense of confidence and mental strength.""I'm stuck in a situation where I have to prove that I'm a woman in order to use these toilets? It's quite offensive. I do try and explain to them quite nicely. I may look this way but, at the end of the day, I am a woman. I have every right to use these toilets.""""There's a very close relationship between passion, dedication and obsession,"" says Campbell.Studying female bodybuilders For over a decade, sociologist Dr. Tanya Bunsell has been researching female bodybuilders.""When I would tell people that I was studying female bodybuilders, the first reaction was, 'That's just not attractive,'"" Dr. Bunsell, a lecturer in Sport and Exercise Science at Canterbury Christ Church University, tells CNN Sport.""There's definitely a glass ceiling on muscularity, and that crossover boundary where the body becomes transgressive and interrogates people's notions of male and female.""The troublesome and disturbing body of the hyper-muscular woman is deemed so outrageously deviant by society that it provokes harsh comments.""""Even though there is a huge market encouraging women to build abs and tighten their figures, the ideal still stands for smaller waists, curvy hips and lean legs, the so-called hourglass figure,"" adds Dr. Bunsell.Campbell takes enormous pride in the way she has reshaped her body.'The body becomes an amazing machine'When she started her bodybuilding career, ​Campbell says eating copious amounts of food was, at first, a shock to the body and mind.""My body temperature went up,"" she says, ​saying that putting on weight initially scared her.""I was feeling hot all the time because you're constantly eating, but once you get over that stage the body becomes an amazing machine and it starts to take that fuel in.""""There's a very close relationship between passion, dedication and obsession,"" says Campbell.""You look at any athlete that has achieved great things, there has to be a certain level of obsession.""A photograph of Campbell is currently featured in a six-month exhibition in west London called ""Womanhood."" Max Ellis, the photographer who took the portait of Campbell, describes his subject as a ""work of art."" ""She's worked her whole life to try and achieve this,"" Ellis ​said. ""If you're a woman and you're doing this [bodybuilding], you are swimming upstream. You're fighting every known convention.""   SteroidsBut bodybuilding has a dark side, a long association with steroid use to help build muscle. ""Before she went to the world championships, Rene had to do a drug test and passed the drug test, but a lot of these girls didn't pass,"" Wanda Tierney, chairperson of IFBB (International Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness) Women's Committee, tells CNN Sport.Campbell says it would be naïve to think that the problem does not exist, but argues that steroids abuse happens in other sports and in society, too.""The onus is on the athletes to adhere to the rules and regulations set by their federation,"" Campbell says. ""My federation (The IFBB), is a signatory to the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) Code, and the IFBB anti-doping rules are in full compliance with the 2015 WADA code.""And as she reflected on her body's evolution, Campbell was keen to stress how bodybuilding had been accompanied by a shift in her mental health.""It was a very big shift for me mentally, because my bodybuilding journey made me realize that I needed to do things for myself."""

Raised by a single mother in New Jersey, Loomis also toyed with the idea of becoming an actor and that's a dream she hasn't given up on as she has pursued her athletics career.""I'm going to use track and field as a way to make a name for myself,"" Loomis, who is a two-time Pan American Games silver medalist and competed at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, tells CNN Sport from her home in the US. She represented Antigua and Barbuda, where her father is from.Pursuing a career in track and field hasn't been easy.""When you are trying to be an elite athlete, on top of trying to get signed on, on top of dealing with coaches, you also have, the pressures, one for me, of being an African-American female representing a Caribbean island.

The power of the word wasn't apparent to me.""Now, I look back like and think, 'What the hell was wrong with me?

Over Brooks' 30 year career, she has treated many patients who suffer from eating disorders and acted as the eating disorders specialist in the HBO film Thin.According to a US study -- Prevalence of Eating disorders among Blacks in the National Survey of American Life -- anorexia was the rarest eating disorder among African American adults and adolescents, while binge eating was the most prevalent eating disorder among adults and adolescents.""We are really understanding more and more that eating disorders are not just a White, suburban women's disease, and that, you know, for a long time the belief was that women of color, particularly Black women, were protected culturally from developing eating disorders,"" said Dr. Brooks.As she trained for her first Olympic appearance in 2016, Loomis adhered to a strict diet.""I would eat super healthy and super clean, be on it for a month.

Everything was low and minimum.""She would be so hungry, she would eat unhealthy things as anyone, and her lack of nutrition was hindering her from performing the correct way that she needed to.""The track and field coach adds: ""A lot of coaches look at, I would say the average high jumper who's professional and look at their height and their weight ratio.""They use that as the standard for what they believe an athlete should be, which in reality is not true all the time.

And that was after she had just competed on the track.The Antiguan and Barbuda Olympic Committee did not immediately respond to CNN Sport's request for comment.Three years later she placed fifth in the high jump at the Commonwealth Games in Australia.

Come to think of it, perhaps even a gold medal wouldn't have been good enough.She also wants to start a wider conversation about the issues surrounding women and body acceptance.Okoro says she started to feel that she wasn't just having to compete on the track. She was having to compete with people's expectations and demands as to what an athlete should look like.According to Okoro, that look was skinny, slender and tall. ""Oh, I can see your veins, this must mean you're in good shape,"" Okoro recalls a conversation she had with coach Charles van Commenee, who worked with the British Athletics team for a number of years, during the prep camp leading into the 2010 European Championships. Okoro says that Van Commenee then asked her about her weight.""Proudly, I was like '60 kilograms,'"" replied Okoro, who considers that her personal ideal race weight.Okoro says that is 15kg heavier than the other athletes she raced against, placing her above traditional weight threshold norms in track and field.According to Okoro, Van Commenee then responded: ""Oh, you must be heavy boned!""Van Commenee, who now works as a motivational speaker on ""high performance culture,"" told CNN Sport: ""Being too light or being too heavy can cause injuries and therefore the staff, led by the head coach, has a duty to address this issue.""It would be unprofessional to turn a blind eye but obviously the right words and the right tone have to be used in addressing the issue,"" he added. Okoro competes in the 800 metres event of the Norwich Union 2006 International Athletics competition at the Alexander stadium, in Birmingham, 20 August 2006. Okoro came fourth with a time of 2.03.08 minutes.After the championships, Okoro says she began working with a nutritionist and was advised to go on a zero-carb diet.""I just thought, 'Okay, you've just taken out all my carbs, so I'm going to have no energy' ... You start to doubt yourself.""Speaking specifically about Okoro, Van Commenee said he doesn't want to have a public debate with the track and field athlete. He continued: ""If she has a problem with anything I may or may not have said, I expect her to speak with me, which she has not done."" However, Van Commenee recalled one conversation with his former athlete where he described Okoro ""ranting about her non-selection for the 800m"" at the 2012 London Olympics adding: ""It was a very painful experience for her.""Okoro remembers the conversation differently.""In 2012, Charles and I had an exchange regarding selections, well, he was just shouting at me in the training facility which embarrassed me.""The 35-year-old Okoro added: ""It was two days before the British trials and the press got a hold of it as it potentially affected my (poor) performance at the championships and ran with the story.""Okoro emphasized that it wasn't to do with her weight on this occasion.""It was more to do with him having to have his way and throw his dominance around,"" she said.Britain's Lee Mcconnell, Christine Ohuruogu, Nicola Sanders and Okoro celebrate on the podium after the women's 4x400m relay final, 02 September 2007, at the 11th IAAF World Athletics Championships, in Osaka.

UKA follows a 'What it Takes to Win' data and analysis framework to assess an athlete's medal winning capacity. The framework talks of ""key physical and technical characteristics of medal winning athletes,"" which will be part of the athlete's review process taken in person with their coach.Charles Van Commenee, Marilyn Okoro and Greg Rutherford of Great Britain speak ahead of the European Athletics Indoor Championships at the Oval Lingotto on March 5, 2009 in Torino, Italy.READ: The death-defying jumps that caught Hollywood's attentionAccording to leading sports scientist Simon Brundish, these characteristics are created through historic performance data.""There are real genetic advantages and genetic barriers to be an elite sprinter or an elite endurance runner,"" Brundish, who's been working in international sports for 22 years, tells CNN Sport.

If she feels strongly about recognizing her Nigerian heritage, Okoro is equally passionate about taking pride in her body shape.""We're expressing ourselves; you know, muscles hold strong and sexy campaigns.""According to Okoro, over the course of her career while working with different coaches, some believed she spent too much time at the gym, but the reality is she mostly trains outdoors. ""I was different to what coaches in the UK perceived to be the image and shape for an 800m runner,"" Okoro said. ""These assumptions were there long before Charles [Van Commenee].""Okoro says that her coaches focused on sprint training and not enough on endurance. It was only when she started to have injuries that Okoro began to question the way she was being coached.""Does this coach really understand? And are they really in it for me?"" she reflects.

""It's very common for body shaming to eventuate from gender stereotyping. More specifically, what it means to be feminine and masculine and how female athletes' bodies may defy this stereotype and in turn be ridiculed for it.""She points out that there have been small shifts in society, such as the body positivity movement, which was originally founded by black women, who celebrated their body types and reclaimed traditionally negative terms such as ""fat.""Yet Dr. Matheson also argues that the body positivity movement has been ""whitewashed, with many campaigns dismissing the origins of the movement.""

""You've got one body, and it was doing pretty great for me, so I needed to look after it,"" said Okoro, who has drawn inspiration from Serena Williams.As Brundish references, Williams has been a key point in the conversation surrounding body image. The 23-time grand-slam champion was criticized for her shape and size. Two years ago, Williams published a letter online addressed to her mother sharing the struggles she's faced with people's body image expectations.  She wrote: ""It has been said I don't belong in women's sports -- that I belong in men's -- because I look stronger than many other women do.""No, I just work hard, and I was born with this badass body and proud of it.""Williams says her daughter Olympia shares the same physique and, in the letter, she expresses, ""I don't know how I would react if she [her daughter] has to go through what I've gone through since I was a 15-year-old and even to this day.""""We don't all look the same. We are curvy, strong, muscular, tall, small, just to name a few, and all the same: we are women and proud!"" Williams said.Okoro has also drawn inspiration from women athletes in rugby and football.""They're not your stereotypical beauty queens but they are caring less about how they look and getting dirty and delivering some great performances.""Okoro wants a new era of role models, or as she calls them ""real models."""

An ex-NFL player wants their stories to be heard","(CNN)Throughout the bitter winter, during rain and snow, Jon Vaughn has alternated between sleeping in a tent or a campervan outside former University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel's house.  A former University of Michigan and NFL football player, Vaughn is one of more than 1,000 people --- mostly men -- who says they were abused by athletics doctor Robert Anderson, who worked for the university from 1966 to 2003 treating students across sports including football, track, and wrestling.  Anderson, who died in 2008, subjected students, 90% of whom were men, to ""sexually abusive conduct"" and invasive exams, including unnecessary genital and rectal examinations, according to a 2021 independent report commissioned by the university.  Many of Anderson's victims were Black -- and survivors say this has played a part in why the abuse was allowed to continue for decades. In his roles at the university, including director of its health service, team physician for the athletic department and a clinical instructor at the university's medical school, Anderson abused men and women from different racial backgrounds, undergraduate and graduate students, student athletes -- including a two-time Super Bowl champion and former world-class wrestler -- and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer community, the report found.  The university missed numerous opportunities to stop him over his 37 year long career, it concluded.  Read MoreThis month the university announced a $490 million settlement with over a thousand victims of Anderson's alleged sexual abuse, pending approval by the Michigan Board of Regents and the claimants. Dr. Robert E. Anderson worked for the University of Michigan from 1966 to 2003. He died in 2008.
But despite the settlement, the University is still facing calls to take responsibility for its role in the abuse, which spanned more than three decades -- as well as the university's failures to address alleged present day sexual misconduct and abuse by and of students and university staff.Victims say that despite knowledge of Dr. Anderson's predatory behavior, U of M failed to take any action, and instead chose to continue enabling Dr. Anderson's abuse of vulnerable young men until his voluntary retirement in 2003.   ""They've shown that over the last half century... [they're] uninterested in student safety as a priority,"" Vaughn, who played for U of M from 1988 to 1990 said. ""They've shown the inability to police themselves on a consistent basis, as pertains to sexual assault,"" he said. Schlissel -- who was fired this month from his position as President following an anonymous complaint suggesting that he ""may have been involved in an inappropriate relationship with a University employee"" -- has apologized for Anderson's ""tragic misconduct,"" and said in a statement that the university is committed to resolving victims' claims.  But Vaughn, 51, who was recently diagnosed with thyroid cancer and has been protesting for more than 100 days says he will continue to sleep outside the university president's house until the University of Michigan addresses historic and alleged present day abuse, after realizing how ""acute"" issues of sexual assault, violence and rape are on campus.  Vaughn is also one of many involved in hundreds of individual lawsuits and a class-action lawsuits filed against the University and the Board of Regents by survivors.  Black men treated differently  The allegations against Anderson mirror those against disgraced USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar at Michigan State University and Richard Strauss at Ohio State University. They too were doctors who abused their trusted positions to sexually exploit college students and athletes.  With more than a thousand people -- mostly men -- coming forward to say they were abused by Anderson, attorneys representing the victims say it may be the largest case of sex abuse by a single person in the US. The scale of the alleged abuse surpasses that at Michigan State, Ohio State, and similar incidents at other US universities.  But the case has received nowhere near as much media coverage as that of the abuse of Nassar.  A disproportionate number of the victims are African American, Vaughn told CNN. ""I don't think the world right now is ready to complete that spectrum of the face of abuse and include African-American men,"" Vaughn told CNN.  Attorney Mike Cox, who is representing 174 victims in confidential federal court mediation with the University of Michigan told CNN that some 40% of the 1000 Anderson victims are African American men. ""We have not done a formal analysis because all are victims and viewed equally in that sense. But clearly the amount of African American victim survivors is much, much higher than their numbers in American society,"" Cox told CNN over email.  Black Americans represent just 13.4% of the American population. The percentage of African American survivors is also ""dramatically higher"" than their percentages as part of the UM student base, Cox said. The University of Michigan agreed to work toward a goal of 10% African American enrollment by 1973, but did not reach this goal: Black student enrollment had declined by 1987 to 5.3% of the student body from the high of 7.7% in 1976 and never reached the 10% goal targeted by administrators in the early '70's. From the 1980s until 1996, there was a 10% increase in African American student enrollment. However, efforts to increase African American enrollment to reflect the Michigan state's 14% Black population have been unsuccessful, according to the university. Vaughn said it took years for him to even recognize what had happened to him as abuse, and that in communities of color, ""for men to even discuss their abuse is seen as a weakness. In those communities, you're forced to be tough and strong.""  ""We've been fighting to have a voice, just typically in this country, for over 400 years, we're constantly and have historically been marginalized, or dehumanized in so many ways. So I really think those two factors create this perfect storm,"" he said. Jon Vaughn says he will continue his protest at the university.Attorney Parker Stinar, who represents around 200 of the survivors, agreed, adding that Anderson's case has not received anywhere near as much media coverage or public recognition as other sex abuse cases because the vast majority of survivors are older, Black men.  ""For Larry Nassar, you had prominently White, 30-year-old women, whereas for Dr. Anderson, the vast majority of the survivors are Black and in their 50s, 60s and 70s. This case is overlooked in part because of that,"" he told CNN. ""I think our society looks down on men who are sexually abused, let alone big, strong, athletic, Black men who are sexually abused, compared to female survivors of abuse,"" Stinar added. ""Because they have this societal influence that asks men: How can they allow themselves to be sexually abused?""Rebecca Wanzo, professor of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Washington University, St. Louis, told CNN that race plays a significant part in whether or how violence and abuse is reported by the media. ""If you don't have someone who's the face of something that they [the media] put forward, or seems like an ideal victim that people want to tell a story about, historically, that is something that can really affect the ability of a story to travel,"" she explained.  This, she said, is often an issue when it comes to reporting issues like sexual abuse and murder. ""Systemic violence often tends to get less attention, which is why violence against people of color, systemic violence in general, in terms of class and other factors, isn't reported,"" she said. Racist stereotypes  ""We don't have a language to talk about Black as rapeable in the US, because the racist stereotypes of Black men as the rapist and as violent stops us from looking at data that's been collected by the CDC for the last decade,"" Tommy Curry, professor of philosophy and personal Chair of Africana Philosophy and Black Male Studies at The University of Edinburgh told CNN. Nearly 1 in 5 (19.4%) non-Hispanic Black men have experienced contact sexual violence -- which includes rape, being made to penetrate someone else, sexual coercion, and unwanted sexual contact -- in their lifetime, according to the CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey 2010-2012, which is the latest published data broken out by race or ethnicity.  Social psychology data shows ""Black men are always perceived as being taller, more aggressive, or violent, more prone to conflict, more athletic than they actually are,"" Curry said. ""And it's those social perceptions that have been linked to forms of dehumanization -- likening them to apes, sorts of primal beasts and animals -- that fit into how we think of Black men, both as athletes and as kind of super predators, as superhuman.""   Attendees add their signatures to a board in support of survivors of sexual abuse at a vigil outside the home of outgoing University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel October 13, 2021 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Former gymnast Trinea Gonczar, who testified against Larry Nassar, told CNN that in her work supporting victims of sexual abuse, she has learned ""that most men, no matter what, if they've been assaulted, they won't report based on more shame.""  Nassar, the longtime doctor for the USA Gymnastics team and Michigan State University, is serving a 60-year sentence in federal prison on child pornography charges, and was also sentenced to a 40-to-175 year state prison sentence in Michigan after pleading guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct. Gonczar has been spending time with Vaughn in his protest to show solidarity with abuse survivors at the University of Michigan. ""In my case, as a privileged woman, my perpetrator is in jail, we received a settlement. I'm White, and I come from an expensive, per se, sport: you have to have money to have to be in that sport,"" Gonczar said. Gonczar now works as director of development at the Avalon Healing Center, which provides support for victims of sexual abuse.  ""I've had to learn that I am a privileged, White person, and all abuse is not the same,"" she said. There are several reasons why Black men choose not to report abuse, Curry told CNN. ""We know from interviews with Black male victims that it's not only the pressures of not being believed -- but it's also being perceived as the aggressor,"" he explained. Curry said that his research had shown that in domestic violence cases, Black men would stay in situations of abuse, or they would not report victimization.  ""They fear that the police or the criminal justice system or society is going to view them as the perpetrator and they'll be criminalized even harsher than the kinds of abuse and violence that they suffer,"" Curry said.  When Black men report that they have been victimized by others, ""different stereotypes activate"", Curry added. ""A lot of racists would say, 'No, he was really the aggressor, he tried to rape me, I wouldn't rape a man. It wasn't me. This person was violent or aggressive, or he's a drug dealer, a thief.'  ""All these racial stereotypes are utilized to undercut the credibility of Black men who are victims in ways that other groups don't have to deal with,"" he said. Conditions that enable abuse Attorney Stephen Estey told CNN that Anderson was easily able to take advantage of his victims. ""Some of these men, they came from the inner city [which had] not the best healthcare in the back of the day,"" Estey, who represents some 80 survivors, said. ""Some of them never had a physical [examination], and so they didn't know what a physical should have been. And Dr. Anderson would tell them, if you want to play football, it's part of the process,"" Estey told CNN.  Wanzo said that a nationwide commitment to protecting athletic programs ""particularly makes Black people vulnerable in the US because they are disproportionately often in some of these programs."" Anderson first served as a University Health Services doctor and was moved to the Athletic Department in 1981 after ""credible reports of misconduct"" were relayed to the then Assistant Vice President of Student Services Thomas Easthope in late 1978 or 1979, according to the WilmerHale report.  ""The fact that they switched him out of general care to the athletic program as if they [athletes] were sort of disposable people says a lot about how the institution thought about how to deal with the problem person: they value athletics as institution, but the people who participate in athletics and make some money are disposable.""  Vaughn told CNN that there are a ""number of dynamics"" aside from race that help perpetuate ""this culture of abuse in sport."" ""I think it is the athlete's dedication to this specific sport, and the overwhelming trust that they tend to have in their coaches and trainers because of the focus that it takes to be successful in sport,"" Vaughn said. Coaches and medical staff are often the most powerful people in a child and student athlete's life, he added. If sports create the perfect conditions for abuse, then institutions are failing to regulate themselves, survivors say. ""It's really the institutions that are protecting their brands, and the position that they hold within that sport, because they really want that sport to be a catalyst for their financial gain instead of taking concern about their sports doctors who are actually predators,"" Gonczar, a gymnast who was treated by Nassar for 15 years, and who estimates that she was molested some 856 times, said.  A number of the women said they had reported Nassar's abuse previously but that the systems of authority, including USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Michigan State University, did not take their concerns seriously.""Absolutely not enough has changed,"" Gonczar said.  ""In the US it's taking so long to just simply get these big institutions to be aware and to be willing to be accountable and transparent, and to have people in the leadership roles that are willing to facilitate that,"" Gonczar warned.  Campus abuse between students ongoing issue The University of Michigan finalized a new sexual and gender based misconduct policy in September, but critics say abuse and assault between students and by university staff still isn't being dealt with well enough. Vaughn said that since he has been protesting, he has been approached by students who have told him of their own experiences of sexual assault and abuse at the university. There were 157 allegations of sexual assault reported to the University's Office for Institutional Equity (OIE) from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, according to its yearly report. The University's Division of Public Safety and Security, which records incidents reported to the DPSS, law enforcement agencies and campus security authorities, described 18 on campus rapes and 31 reports of fondling not associated with Anderson in 2020. Some 106 reports of sexual assault were made to the University's Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center (SAPAC) in 2020, down from 151 in 2019 and 168 in 2018.  Vaughn says he has spoken to students who feel harrassment is still a problem at the university.There were 77 reported instances of sexual harassment and 57 reports of stalking, according to the University's Division of Public Safety and Security, which provided the data as ""additional information regarding crime reports on campus.""   Campus enrollment in 2019 stood at 48,090 students, and 47,907 enrolled in 2020. ""All the reporting agencies within the university have essentially failed all the students and all the student athletes, because they've done nothing to support in any consistent manner, or protect in any consistent manner,"" Vaughn said. ""Professors have said if you support or even help report a student's standpoint, it's like a career suicide,"" he added.  Some 42.4 percent of Michigan students said they had experienced at least one type of harassing behavior since entering school, and more than a quarter (26.9 percent) of undergraduate women reported nonconsensual sexual contact, according to a campus climate survey regarding sexual misconduct.  Out of women who say they experienced harassment, 8.9 percent of Michigan undergraduates reported the person was a teacher, advisor, boss, supervisor, or co-worker compared to an average of 4.8 percent of undergraduates and across the 33 schools surveyed in the overall survey, which looked at responses from a total of 181,752 students from 33 colleges and universities. Some 31.8 percent of graduate or professional Michigan students reported their harasser to be a teacher, advisor, boss, supervisor, or co-worker, compared to an average 16.5 percent in the overall survey.  Vaughn has slept in a tent and later, a trailer, to protest at the University over issues of sexual abuse and assault.Vaughn has been protesting through harsh conditions at the University of Michigan.The overall survey found that the 33 schools surveyed, more than half of undergraduate women (59.2%) and transgender, genderqueer, and non-binary students (65.1%) reported experiencing at least one harassing behavior.  ""I speak to a lot of students, many of them feel like with the assaults that have happened to them, that the university has not been able to deal with it properly,"" Charlie Kolean, chairman of Michigan Students Against Sexual Assault told CNN. ""Typically, a case will not be criminally referred. And additionally, a lot of survivors from assault, they don't want to go through the university's process reporting the assault, because it is fairly arduous,"" he added. Emma Sandberg, a former student and founder of activism group Roe v. Rape told CNN: ""Overall, it is very difficult to be a survivor at U of M. The sexual assault prevention center doesn't provide any real resources, university leadership has engaged in sexual misconduct themselves, and those who go through the all-consuming Title IX process are traumatized by it and rarely receive justice, support, or validation.  ""We need a supportive center for survivors, not just a preventative one, and we need more effective prevention methods at all levels,"" Sandberg, who graduated in in 2021, said. In addition to Anderson, at least five current and former university professors and officials have faced accusations of sexual harassment or abuse in the last few years.In a statement to CNN, Rick Fitzgerald, associate vice president of Public Affairs and Internal Communications at the University of Michigan said: ""We encourage every incident of misconduct to be reported and we take action,"" pointing towards the university's annual report for further details.  ""SAPAC has a 30-year history of supporting and advocating for survivors of sexual misconduct, through a range of supportive services, based on individual needs,"" he said, pointing towards the university's confidential resources for students and staff.He added: ""The University of Michigan always has taken sexual misconduct seriously and we have been increasing our efforts steadily,"" and that a Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center has been on campus for almost 40 years. Fitzgerald added that any case that involves criminal behavior is ""first turned over to police and the ECRT investigation is put on hold so that criminal activity can always be addressed first.""  Vaughn wants the university to overhaul its approach to misconduct. ""You cannot only celebrate parts of your history, you must deal with your entire history in order to root it out and change that culture,"" he said. ""Because the longer you ignore it, the more you perpetuate it and the more it empowers other predators, because they're watching the lack of discipline, or consequences for serial predators and rapists that then gives others the green light to make those decisions and prey on young men and young women."" Co-lead class counsel attorney E. Powell Miller told CNN his team is seeking ""class action relief for reforms, policies and procedures to prevent an Anderson problem from occurring again.""  Attorney Jonathan Selbin, co-lead class counsel in a class action suit against the University, told CNN: ""While paying money to the victims is a critical first step, U of M must also commit to system-wide changes that bring all of the stakeholders together to reform the campus and institutional culture and prevent abuses like this from ever occurring again."" Vaughn wants the university to create programs that empower students to report instances of sexual violence, and strengthen mechanisms to protect students. Last July, the university announced revisions to how it will address sexual misconduct, including the creation of a new office with ""significant"" new resources for support, education and prevention. The office was launched in August.  ""I knew that there was nothing that I could do in my protest to change what happened to me. But we could uncover the truth here at Michigan, and also make this place safer for now, and in the future, so that these atrocities don't continue to happen,"" Vaughn said. ""We want to change the narrative, as well as the culture. So until that's done, I won't be leaving."""

The story of his life and the movement he has inspired is being republished by CNN International to mark the anniversary of his death. This article was first published on June 28, 2021. (CNN)It was the worst news that anybody could have woken up to; as Sardar Pashaei reached for his phone one morning in September, he knew immediately that something terrible had happened.  ""When I woke at about six or seven o'clock in the morning,"" he told CNN Sport, ""I see a lot of phone calls from Persian television. And when I listened to the voicemail of my journalist friend, I just cried. I couldn't control my tears."" The Iranian Pashaei, who was the 1998 Junior 60-kilogram Greco-Roman World Wrestling champion, has been living in self-imposed exile in the US since 2009.On that fateful morning, he learned that another Iranian wrestler, Navid Afkari, had been executed, hanged for a crime that his family and friends say he didn't commit.  Pashaei, who was close to Afkari's coach in Iran, had been campaigning hard to save his life. It was a campaign that ended brutally with a hangman's noose, but in the months since Afkari was silenced, his voice seems only to have grown louder. Read MoreAn ancient sportWrestling is one of the oldest sports in Iran and it is one of the most popular. Ever since winning their first Olympic wrestling medal at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Iranian wrestlers have excelled at the Games, returning home with a total of 43 medals to date, more than double the haul in their next best sport -- weightlifting.  Pashaei says that there's a wrestling gym ""in every corner of every city in Iran,"" and successful wrestlers there are treated differently, enjoying an elevated status in comparison to other athletes. They're on a pedestal.  Iranians wrestle during a workout session at the traditional Shir Afkan ""zurkhaneh"" (House of Strength) gymnasium in the capital Tehran in February 2018.The ancient sport is naturally aggressive and competitive, but experts say it's a combat sport borne out of a practice to promote inner strength through outer strength.When viewed through such a lens, wrestling might not seem too dissimilar to yoga. The spirit of wrestling is deeply engrained in Iranian culture, where it has transcended the arena of sport.Max Fisher wrote in The Atlantic in 2012 that ""The ideal practitioner is meant to embody such moral traits as kindness and humility and to defend the community against sinfulness and external threats.""  One could argue that it was these very qualities that got Afkari executed -- by his own government.  'He was the best one'Afkari was born on July 22, 1993, and raised in the city of Shiraz; located in the southwest region of Iran, it's one of the oldest cities in Ancient Persia and known to be a hotbed of poets, literature, flowers and wine.Legend has it that the famous Syrah grape, grown as far afield as the Rhône Valley in France and in the new world territories of Australia, New Zealand and California, first took root in Shiraz.  It was here that a young Afkari learned to find his way in the world. One of five children, he discovered wrestling at the age of nine and quickly dedicated his life to the sport.By the time he was 17, he was good enough to be included in a group of eight wrestlers in the 69-kg category that attended a national training camp. Six years later, Pashaei says Afkari was ranked second in his division and on track to fulfill his dream of one day becoming an Olympic champion.  Parents will usually try to avoid having a favorite child or revealing the truth if they do have a preference, but Afkari's three brothers and sister knew their place in the family. Sources close to them say that he was the apple of his mother's eye; Afkari was successful, but modest, and he was never a burden to them. A family member, speaking to CNN Sport only on the understanding that their identity would be protected, described Afkari as ""the nicest member of the family,"" adding that his friends would agree: ""He was the best one.""  Navid Afkari (bottom left), sitting with his brother Vahid (top left), brother Saeid (bottom center), Habib (bottom right) father (top center) and mother (top right). Videos of him with his hands in the air, dancing and singing at home during Persian New Year, and somersaulting acrobatically into a swimming pool confirm the family's description of Afkari as ""enthusiastic, full of energy and excitement."" Such positivity would rub off on those closest to him, especially within his family.  They say that he wasn't particularly interested in politics, but he was keen to help out in the community, making donations and helping the poor, and he was troubled by the culture of discrimination in Iran, especially against women and those living in poverty.   That's why Afkari took part in the seismic demonstrations that swept through the country in 2018.Initially, these were protests against the government's economic policies, but they soon morphed into political opposition of the theocratic regime and its Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and were regarded as the most significant domestic challenge to the government in almost a decade.  Afkari was concerned about rising prices in Iran, so -- along with millions of others -- he took to the streets to protest. His family says he was frustrated by corruption and poverty and worried that daily life was no longer affordable to many of his compatriots.  It was a fateful decision that would end up costing him his life.  A forced confession / A lack of evidenceAccording to the official version of events, Afkari killed Hassan Torkman, a water company security employee, during a protest in Shiraz on August 2, 2018. Afkari and his brother, Vahid, were arrested a month and a half later, on September 17 according to the UN, and another brother, Habib, was rounded up later that year. Afkari was condemned to death; Vahid and Habib received prison sentences of more than 33 and 15 years respectively and all were to be punished with 74 lashes each, according to Amnesty International. Initially, Afkari confessed to the crime, but in court he retracted those words, arguing that he had been tortured during his interrogation by ""men with hats, glasses and masks on,"" and that a false confession had been forced out of him. His supporters say that his trial was devoid of any compelling evidence, and in fact, the only video evidence available, from a closed-circuit television camera, would have been more likely to prove his innocence. Afkari's attorney, Hassan Younesi, told the Center for Human Rights in Iran that ""There is no visual evidence of the moment of the crime, and the film presented in this case shows scenes an hour before the time of the murder."" In this June 2018 photo, a group of protesters chant slogans at the main gate of the Old Grand Bazaar, in Tehran, Iran. The case of 27-year-old Navid Afkari has drawn the attention of a social media campaign that portrays him and his brothers as victims targeted over participating in protests against Iran's Shiite theocracy in 2018. An audio recording was made in the court and leaked by human rights activists; in it, an agitated Afkari, speaking in a high-pitched voice, can be heard pleading with the judge, who seems to have little interest in giving him a fair hearing. Such recordings of court proceedings are extremely rare in Iran and whoever made it and released it would have done so at great personal risk.  The prosecution claimed to have video evidence of the crime committed at the specific time of 11:32 p.m., but according to the audio tape, it was never shown in court and the defendant was never able to see it for himself.Long readsAustralia's first international cricketers won fame abroad.

""We are not afraid of anything,"" responds the judge. On the recording, Afkari demands that his witness, Shahin Nasseri, be heard, somebody who can testify to the abuse he experienced while being held in police detention for nearly 50 days.In a complaint filed with the judiciary in September 2019, Afkari described ""the most severe and physical psychological torture,"" but according to Iran's state-run news agency, IRNA, the head of the Fars Province Judiciary rejected claims that Afkari had been beaten or tortured and, in court, he was dismissed out of hand.""Not related. Not the time for it, sit down, don't talk anymore!"" ordered the judge on the recording. ""You do not have a defense.""The Iranian government has said repeatedly that Afkari was not tortured and that his confession wasn't forced. CNN has asked the government if he received a fair trial, but we have not received a response.The executionAccording to the Afkari family, his final days were brutal, but there wasn't necessarily any reason to think that the end was near.The family says that he was kept in solitary confinement for a week and ""beaten by 20 guards,"" before being told that he and his brothers were being moved from the prison in Shiraz to the capital, Tehran.That was a lie; instead, Afkari was executed on September 12th, at the age of 27. Much later, family members learned that Vahid and Habib were in a cell close to the gallows where they had heard their brother die.   His body was returned to his family in the middle of the night, and they say he was denied a proper burial. The authorities had already dug a hole in the dirt and that's where Navid was expected to be placed.In the months that have passed since, he has hardly been able to rest in peace. The family has tried to honor Afkari, by placing a stone to inscribe in remembrance and a wall to protect it, but they say it was broken down by the authorities with a bulldozer. As the Afkaris tried to prevent further damage, the father was arrested, and they were cautioned that the whole site could be completely destroyed.  Iranians in Canada on Mel Lastman Square demonstrate against the execution of wrestler Navid Afkari by the Iranian regime, in Toronto, Ontario in September 2020. The death sentence caused international uproar, yet the regime persisted.  As such, Afkari's final resting place is now just a simple grave.  His death was a crippling blow to those who had loved him and also to those who had never even met him.So successful was the campaign to raise awareness of his plight that Dana White, the head of UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) asked then US President Donald Trump to appeal to Iran for clemency. Unfortunately, though, their efforts were in vain.  Speaking shortly after Afkari's death in a press conference, White tried to make sense of it all but could only conclude that ""he was fighting for what he believed in. And it cost him his life."" One UFC fighter, Bobby Green, was so emotional that he could think of nothing else after beating Alan Patrick in Las Vegas.Green, who was a wrestler himself before turning to Mixed Martial Arts, cut short his post-fight interview by saying, ""Somebody just lost their life for protesting; that just messed me up. I thought we were going to be able to save him. That is so sad, it broke my heart. I don't even want to talk right now.""Inciting a culture of fearAfkari was one of at least 267 people who were executed in Iran in 2020.A report compiled by Iran Human Rights and advocacy group Together Against the Death Penalty (ECPM) concluded that Iran can boast of the highest number of confirmed executions in the world per capita, and that The Islamic Republic uses executions ""as a tool to oppress political dissidents, including protesting citizens, ethnic minorities and journalists."" IHR's director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam explained that the regime creates fear through the death penalty to maintain power, but that fear is now waning.""Protests in recent years,"" he said in the report, ""have shown that not only are people losing their sense of fear but they are also uniting in their anger against these executions."" Navid's mother (left) stands by Navid's grave in March 2021 in Shiraz, Iran. While still grieving, Afkari's friends and family are dealing with further intimidation.His former coach, Mohammad Ali Chamiani, says he has been warned not to talk about him, and just in case there is any misunderstanding, he's been banned from teaching wrestling, sacked by his gym and stripped of his benefits and insurance. It's a humiliating end to Ali Chamiani's career; until recently, he was revered, considered on three separate occasions to be the top wrestling coach in the country. The family is now concerned for the safety of their other sons in prison but they say that Afkari has prepared them to be strong.Throughout the two years that he was imprisoned, family members say he was building them up, allaying their fears where possible and ensuring that they'd be able to continue his struggle when he was gone. He knew that he was going to be put to death, but in his last night alive, his family says he called them to say that he was doing OK, asking them not to worry. United for NavidAfkari may be gone, but his voice is now louder than ever. The recording of him defiantly challenging the judge can be found all over social media, so, too, an audio recording that he made while he was in jail.  ""During all the years that I wrestled,"" he states calmly, ""I never faced a cowardly opponent who played dirty because wrestling is an inherently honorable sport. But it's been two years that my family and I have had to face off against injustice and the most cowardly and dishonorable opponent."" Upon realizing that his legal challenge was destined to fail, he concluded, ""They are just looking for a neck to throw their noose around."" One of his most prominent supporters is Masih Alinejad, an exiled Iranian journalist, author and political activist, who's now living in New York. She never met Afkari, but she later learned that he had reached out to her during the protests.  People protest against Iran's death penalty opposite Downing Street as a march to demand a people's vote against Brexit passes by on October 2018 in London, England. On February 12, 2018, Alinejad had posted an image on Instagram of an Iranian woman who'd been arrested for protesting the compulsory headscarf (Hijab) law. Among the list of 1,648 comments was one from Afkari, whose public courage and audacity would have been inconceivable to many in Iran.In Farsi, he posted a direct attack on the Supreme Leader, a line which translates to ""I spit on your rotten soul."" Alinejad's original post received over 71,000 likes and could have been seen by any of her five million followers.  Alinejad told CNN that it was Afkari's brief comment, quickly lost in the sea of social media, that has posthumously formed such an unbreakable bond between them. ""I was shocked at how brave he was,"" she told CNN Sport. ""He cursed the Supreme Leader of Iran, in public, under his own name. That is why I care so much about Navid. That actually breaks my heart. I did my best, but sometimes I feel miserable and frustrated that we couldn't save him. ""We have so many Navids now fighting for freedom,"" Alinejad explained, ""fighting for equality, fighting for justice, fighting for dignity, fighting to have a normal life, fighting to get rid of dictatorship.""  Tokyo 2020'I felt my body was still capable': Meet the moms hoping to shine at the OlympicsOlympic silver medalist food for Uber Eats to fund Tokyo 2020 dreamTriple jumping rapper on why his music is his 'love language'How a married couple navigated the 'purgatory' of a postponed OlympicsAlinejad believes that the government viewed Afkari as a threat and moved quickly to silence him, using his execution as a deterrent to others, adding, ""His only crime was just joining Iran protests and that scares the government. The government actually wanted to create fear within the society."" But his execution might prove to have been a miscalculation; it may have backfired.  Alinejad is the campaign founder of United for Navid, an action group that is keeping his voice alive.Afkari's sacrifice has motivated many Iranian athletes to find the courage to step up and speak out; while some want politics to be separated from sport in their country, all agree on the need for even greater reforms.She understands the risks that many of them are taking. ""Sometimes, when you keep silent, they can execute you. Sometimes, when you speak up, they can execute you. So that is why we have to do something beyond just talking about Navid, talking about his goal. He wanted to have greater freedom. He wanted to have a better country [in which] to live."" Iranian-American supporters of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) protest the execution of wrestler Navid Afkari by Iran, in front of the White House in Washington, D.C. in September 2020. The execution ended the life of Afkari, but it has failed to silence his voice. He continues speaking from beyond the grave: ""If there's one thing I learned from stepping onto the wrestling mat,"" he was recorded saying in jail, ""it's that I should never give into oppression and lies."" That spirit seems to be alive in his family; despite enormous pressure to comply with the government and blacken Afkari's name, they are standing firm. ""We care about the good thing that we have to do. We care about our goal, rather than think about the tortures and fear,"" said his relative, adding that Afkari's mother is torn between conflicting emotions. ""She has two feelings right now. She's so sad for losing Navid. And secondly, she's so proud of Navid because she knows that Navid chose the right path.""  Afkari has become larger in death than he ever was in life. Pashaei concludes that the campaign of which he is a spokesman is now an unstoppable force.""They thought that by killing this guy, they can bury his name like his body. But it never happened. Now, we see that he's a champ. He's a hero for millions of young athletes. He's everywhere now."""

For them, the battle isn't just on the field of play, it's also away from the arenas, where the consequences of their actions could be painful, even deadly.""I am 100% fearful,"" judoka Vahid Sarlak tells CNN Sport. He knows fighting for his beliefs could end badly in a country where political activists and their families are routinely intimidated, arrested and can even be executed. ""Every day, my mom asks me not to do this, she is worried daily. But I say, 'I was born once, and I'll die once.' I have sworn that I'll fight for my freedom for as long as I'm alive.""When asked to detail the kind of threats that she is facing, the soccer player Shiva Amini tries to make light of it, telling CNN: ""SMS messages, such as 'We will cut your head off and send a picture of it to your family.' Do you want just one example, or do you want to hear the rest?""Read MoreThey used to say that sport and politics shouldn't mix, but those days seem to be a distant memory. In many parts of the western world, athletes are now using their platforms to shape social and political discourse.In Iran, sport and politics have always mixed, but it's the theocratic government that makes the rules and enforces them through fear. The former junior world champion wrestler Sardar Pashaei knows exactly what can be at stake; he campaigned to try and save the life of wrestler Navid Afkari, who was executed in 2020. Afkari's death became a rallying cry for athletes in Iran to unite and push for change in a campaign called 'United for Navid.'""If we be silenced today, we don't have anything to tell our children tomorrow,"" Pashaei told CNN.All three are now living in self-imposed exile abroad, where it's a little safer to be outspoken; all are brave, but all have been traumatized by years of harassment and intimidation. When asked if he fears for his life, the former karate international champion Mahdi Jafargholizadeh scoffed at the suggestion: ""I died 20 years ago. I lost everything when I was in Iran. If you kill me again, you just killed a dead person.""In 2017, soccer player Shiva Amini was forced to apply for asylum in Switzerland because she was observed playing without the compulsory hijab while outside of Iran.An eternal blowSarlak might be a judoka, but he could easily have been a poet.""Have you ever been in love?"" he asked CNN Sport. ""Sport is love,"" he opined. ""When you meet a girl for the first time, fall in love and then lose her, would it mean that you will never fall in love again? I'm sure you will, 100% sure. The next love will come.""At the age of 40, Sarlak is still madly in love with his sport. He says a life without sport would feel ""the same as death."" But he's had his heart broken more than once and in ways that most athletes couldn't even begin to imagine.At the age of 17, he says he was ordered to lose by his team at the World Junior Championships. Deliberately losing is an alien concept to any athlete but it's not for Iranian athletes in international competitions.When entering a tournament, they don't fear the prospect of running into a stronger opponent, their biggest concern is that an Israeli athlete lies ahead of them in the draw because their government's unwritten rule means that they're not going to be allowed to compete against them.Sarlak says that the first time he was told to lose in 1998, he didn't give it much thought -- he was still so young. But when it happened at the 2005 World Championships in Cairo, he was absolutely devastated.""It was the most difficult moment of my life,"" he recalled. ""I was just crying and asking why? Why should I lose? I remember my coach slapped me and told me: 'You know that you have to go and lose the match.'""Other stories by Don RiddellThe untold story of the Munich OlympicsHow boxing is changing the way society looks at women in GazaHow a nation of just 11 million people became world's top-ranked football teamBaseball star took a knee and then his life unraveled in Trump's AmericaSarlak was fighting in the 60kg repechage and on course for a bronze medal; he'd been drawn against an opponent from Azerbaijan, but Israel's Gal Yekutiel was up next.His coach delivered the news that no athlete would ever want to hear: ""Your next opponent will be an Israeli, and we are not permitted to be in a match with Israelis.""Nearly 16 years after the event, Sarlak is still traumatized by it and the details of that day have been seared into his memory.He says that the broadcast cameras were trained on him because they realized he'd thrown the match. His coach put a towel over his head and he was rushed back to the hotel, denying him the chance to watch the rest of the competition.""I broke all the windows in my room,"" recalls Sarlak. ""It was the worst day of my life. A hole opened inside of me and that hole is still open. The dream of having that medal has remained with me. I will never forgive them."" To add insult to injury, Sarlak says he's still taunted about it.""Even now, when I see my Azeri opponent, he tells me, 'Your medal is on display at my house. Your medal is on my neck now. You didn't want it and I won it.' This will never be erased from my mind.""CNN has asked the Iranian government if it acknowledges that it has prevented athletes from competing against Israelis. We also asked if they will allow their athletes to compete against Israeli opponents at the Olympics this year. They have not responded to our inquiry.Iran's Vahid Sarlak duels with Spain's Javier Fernandez in the up to and including 60 kgs men's open category during the World Judo Championships in Cairo in September 2005. Sarlak says he was forced to default from the tournament after he'd been drawn against an opponent from Israel. 'I'm not going back'Jafargholizadeh had always wanted to be a karate champion. He says his father was the head coach of the national team, but he didn't believe in his son. ""I remember one day I was wearing his national team jacket,"" Jafargholizadeh told CNN Sport. ""He just slapped me in the face and said, 'Who the hell are you? You get it yourself.'"" That was all the motivation that Mahdi needed. ""OK, I said, I'll show you.""He was barely a teenager when one of the top teams in the country took an interest in him, and in time, he was competing internationally -- a national champion picking up more than 20 medals all over the world. But Jafargholizadeh says it all came to a screeching halt when he was thrown in jail in 2004, arrested at the airport and accused of planning to be an Israeli spy. He says he was tortured and interrogated for five to six months and even threatened with the death penalty.Tokyo 2020'I felt my body was still capable': Meet the moms hoping to shine at the OlympicsOlympic silver medalist food for Uber Eats to fund Tokyo 2020 dreamTriple jumping rapper on why his music is his 'love language'How a married couple navigated the 'purgatory' of a postponed OlympicsHe relays the experience in a stream of consciousness and a smile that belies the suffering he endured.""They break my nose, many different stuff that I don't even want to talk about.""He says the accusations were so incredulous that he didn't take them seriously at first, but it reached a point where he couldn't take it anymore and he started goading his tormentors to go make good on their threats.""I never forget that I had a shirt with buttons,"" he recalled, gesturing that he ripped it open and declared: ""Take your gun and shoot me here now. Or you want to hang me later on? Do it now!""It's scarcely believable that Jafargholizadeh was eventually released from jail and able to resume his competitive career at the top level, fighting again at the 2005 and 2007 Asian championships and winning gold and silver medals with his team.But after another brush with authority in 2008, he realized that it was no longer safe for him to remain in the country. His opposition to the government in Iran wasn't much of a secret, and he was perhaps something of a marked man. According to Jafargholizadeh, the President of the Karate Federation, a man ""who has been in the intelligence service for years and years,"" saw him with tattoos all over his body and declared it would be his last year with the national team. ""I take my last chance; I'm not going back again. I didn't go back. I left the national team in Germany and became a refugee,"" said Jafargholizadeh.Forced to forfeitMany young Iranians dream of becoming professional athletes, but they can't imagine the pitfalls that will come with their exposure to the international community.""Every Iranian has a passport,"" explains Sarlak. ""On the first page, it is written that you can travel to any country you would like to go -- except 'the occupied Palestine.'""Sarlak says even speaking the name Israel just isn't done in Iran.""We all know that, but the intensity of this problem is more obvious with athletes because we face situations with Israel. Ordinary people may not have to deal with it, [but] this problem is a flashpoint for athletes that will never go away.""It's well known that athletes from Iran are prevented from competing against Israelis -- in any competition.In the main sports where they could have met at the Olympics -- boxing, judo, taekwondo and wrestling -- there has never once been a contest between athletes from either country. It almost happened at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, when a swimmer from each country was drawn to race in the fourth heat of the first round of the 100-meter breaststroke. But the Iranian swimmer, Mohammad Alirezaei, never showed up.In 2017, the wrestler Alireza Mohammad Karimimachiani was in a winning position against Russia's Alikhan Zhabrailov at the Under-23 World Championship in Poland, when his coach became animated on the sideline. He can be seen and heard on the broadcast highlights calling from the floor: ""Lose Ali!"" The clip, which can still be viewed at UWW.Org, reveals an increasingly desperate coach imploring his athlete to throw in the towel: ""Alireza! Lose Alireza! Alireza! You must lose! Alireza, you must lose! Israel won. Israel has won.""The Israeli Uri Kalashnikov had just beaten the American Samuel Brooks and was awaiting the winner in the next round. It was the second time in his career that Karimimachiani says he had been told to lose, later he told the semi-official Iranian Students News Agency that ""my whole world seemed to come to an end.""Iran's Saeid Mollaei (in white) fights against Belgium's Matthias Casse during the semifinal of the men's under 81kg category during the 2019 Judo World Championships at the Nippon Budokan, a venue for the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Mollaei, who claimed he was ordered to deliberately lose a world championship fight, could compete under a refugee flag at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, officials said on September 1.  A much clearer instruction can be heard in an audio recording made at the 2019 World Judo Championships in Tokyo, when Saeid Mollaei was ordered to lose his semifinal in order to steer clear of the Israeli world champion Sagi Muki. ""Based on my stance, that of the regime and that of the minister, he has no right to compete,"" says the president of Iran's Judo Federation in the recording.The ambient noise of the competition is audible in the background as he concludes with a scarcely veiled threat: ""The circumstances stipulate that one should never question this stance. Make him understand that he has no right to compete under no circumstances. He is responsible for his actions.""Sarlak now lives in Germany; he breaks down in tears and leaves the interview when explaining that he hasn't been able to see his parents for 12 years. Jafargholizadeh resides in the mountains of Finland and the 1998 junior world Greco-Roman wrestling champion Pashaei is exiled in the US.He fled in 2008, when it became apparent that his Kurdish ethnicity and the connection to his politically active father was shutting down career opportunities.As a coach, he says he was barred from traveling out of the country with the national team.A year before he made the decision to flee the country, he witnessed one of his wrestlers being denied the chance to fight; he told CNN that he watched from a distance as Babak Ghorbani was given the news.""He was sitting on the stage in the stadium and he couldn't believe it. He was crying and crying. He was telling me, 'You know how hard I worked! I don't deserve this!'""This is not just about losing one match, it affects your whole life. Your dignity has been taken away by other people, people who are usually members of the intelligence service who don't know the pain of being an athlete. This is sport, it has to be about peace and friendship, but they teach you to hate.""An Israeli man of Iranian descent holds Iran's pre-revolution flag in support of Iranian judoka Saeid Mollaei during the Tel Aviv Grand Slam 2021 on February 19, 2021.'Girls had no value'Many countries would be delighted to see their athletes and teams triumph on the world stage.In the purest sense, sporting success can be a boost to domestic morale, but it can also be used as a means of wielding soft power on the international stage. Sport is a good way to make friends and influence people -- and so they're willing to make heavy investments or even cheat to achieve those ends.Iranian athletes have come to realize, though, that the opposite is true for them. Iran seems to routinely sabotage its own sporting success and its female athletes are in no doubt about that. They often feel as though they have to compete with one hand tied behind their backs -- that's if they're allowed to compete at all.Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran hasn't sent a female athlete to compete at the Olympics in swimming, wrestling or gymnastics, none of which would be possible while wearing the compulsory hijab.Shiva Amini says her proudest achievement with the national women's soccer team was at the 2009 Indoor Asian Games in Vietnam, where her Futsal team beat Uzbekistan and Japan to win their group, before losing to Jordan in the semifinals.""With all the difficulties of wearing a hijab, in the heat in Vietnam, we were able to win,"" she explained to CNN. ""Despite all the difficulties, because of the love we have for football and sport, we could fight and be just like any other girls.""Amini details the inconvenience of competing in a hijab, how it restricts the ability to move and how it becomes heavy with sweat: ""We had a hard time even breathing."" And if the scarf became loose or if the sleeves rolled up their arms, the referee would blow the whistle to stop the game and a scoring opportunity might have been lost.Amini, who was regarded as the most technically gifted player in the women's game in Iran, says that she and the female team were made to feel as if their status was little more than token.Long readsAustralia's first international cricketers won fame abroad.

I realized that us girls had no value. It was an insult and a humiliation.""In 2017, Amini was playing football in Switzerland and she posted pictures of it on her social media accounts.Given that she wasn't on official business with the country of Iran, she didn't give it a second thought, until the pictures appeared everywhere back home and caused a storm of controversy: she wasn't wearing her hijab and she was playing with ""anti-Islam"" teams.""For a few weeks, the entire internet was filled with stories about me,"" Amini told CNN. ""It created a very bad situation for my family in Iran and myself in Switzerland.""She hired lawyers in both countries, but soon came to realize that the situation was now beyond her control.""They have fully politicized this event and put your name on a blacklist in Iran,"" she said she was told. ""I was not prepared to deal with what was about to happen, my life was about to fully change in all aspects, I did not have a good mental condition.""Amini has not been home since and says both she and her family are routinely harassed and intimidated.Navid Afkari: Executed Iranian wrestling star's voice is 'everywhere now'Campaigning for justiceIn September 2020, a dreadful event motivated these four athletes and many others to come together and tell their stories.The execution of wrestler Afkari -- capital punishment for a murder that his family and friends say that he did not commit -- galvanized the sports community and spurred it into action. Within the last few months, the United for Navid Campaign has been writing to Thomas Bach, President of the International Olympic Committee and the Executive Board at the IOC, calling for immediate action to be taken against the National Olympic Committee of Iran.In letters sent on March 5, March 25 and April 19, United for Navid has provided the names and case studies of 20 athletes who've been negatively impacted by political interference in Iran.""We have a simple question,"" states the United for Navid campaign spokesman Pashaei: ""Can IOC member states torture and arrest athletes and violate the [Olympic] charter? Are you doing anything to protect these athletes? Because their rights are being discriminated against every single day.""IOC President Thomas Bach speaks during a press conference in Tokyo on November 16, 2020. Within the last few months, the United for Navid Campaign has been writing to Bach, calling for immediate action to be taken against the NOC of Iran. According to the charter's Fundamental Principles of Olympism, ""the practice of sport is a human right"" and ""sports organizations within the Olympic Movement shall apply political neutrality."" Access to sport should be enjoyed without ""discrimination of any kind, such as race, color, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.""The charter concludes: ""Belonging to the Olympic Movement requires compliance with the Olympic Charter.""In an impassioned plea, the emotion is clear in Pashaei's voice as he continues listing to CNN the many ways in which the integrity and safety of Iranian athletes is compromised by their own government.""When they don't compete with Israeli athletes, they tell the IOC that this is their personal decision. It's a big lie. Every single trip, there are members of security intelligence watching the athletes 24/7 and if they do something wrong, they have been punished.""I want to ask IOC, are you aware of this? You talk about gender equality and race equality. Are you aware that one of your members is violating the charter all the time? You have been silent about this; we're not going to be silenced."" A picture taken on March 8, 2021 in Lausanne shows the Olympic rings next to the headquarters of the IOC.Of the 20 case studies that have been sent to the IOC so far, only 12 athletes have been identified. The names of eight others have been withheld to protect them, as they are still living in Iran. Amini says those athletes fully support the campaign. ""They are very happy with this movement. They encourage us, they push us forward. And the one thing they all say is, 'All of our hopes are in you guys,'"" Amini told CNN.There is an element of risk, also, for the athletes living outside of Iran -- many of them still have family at home.""Once in a while they question our parents, brothers and sisters, they threaten them,"" says Pashaei. ""But our families, all of them, believe that we're doing the right thing.""  So far, the IOC's only response has been a tacit acknowledgment that they have received the documentation from the campaign.In a March press conference, spokesman Mark Adams said: ""I don't know to be honest, I think -- I believe -- we have. And as with all communications, it will be dealt with in due course, but it wasn't discussed at the Executive Board today. But trust us, it will be dealt with.""Former junior world champion wrestler Sardar Pashaei says there's ""an element of risk"" for athletes outside the country to campaign against Iran's NOC.United for Navid is optimistic that the IOC will, ultimately, take action.Earlier this year, their pressure campaign led to the International Judo Federation banning the Iran team for four years, but they're hoping that the action can be urgent. In the letter dated March 25, Pashaei concludes with the line, ""We look forward to your timely response. Every day that passes without action results in more athlete mistreatment."" Pashaei says there is evidence to suggest that the current head of Iran's Olympic Committee used to be a top-ranking member of Iran's intelligence agency, as detailed in a 2018 report from VOA/Radio Farda: ""He was involved in arresting and torturing people. He is going to the Olympic Games.""""Even a little change will make a big difference,"" concludes Jafargholizadeh. He and the other campaigners are confident that action from arguably the biggest governing body in world sport would force Iran to take politics out of sport and treat the athletes better.But it might take an Olympic ban to do it. ""A lot of people think we are against sport in Iran,"" he said, disputing that fact. ""They have to know we have been athletes. We have been part of that national team for years and years. We just want to say, 'Stop torturing people and killing them.'""""It's about our dignity,"" says Pashaei. ""We're not going to give up. We're going to go to the end."""

He sees that mission as not just developing talented footballers, but also teaching them valuable life skills.Türkgücü Munich is making waves in Germany both on the sporting and political sceneREAD: Your Country Needs You! What nationality means to the modern-day footballerA club for all   ""Preserving traditions, connecting cultures,"" is Türkgücü's motto.    The club's crest is a mix of the Turkish and Bavarian flags and is an ode to the club's founding fathers -- Turkish immigrants, for whom Bavaria was home, and who established Türkgücü in 1975. ""I feel German, but I also love my Turkish roots,"" Ünal Tosun, one of Türkgücü's leading player, tells CNN Sport.    The world's largest Turkish diaspora can be found in Germany and Tosun, who is the son of Turkish immigrants, is a physical embodiment of Türkgücü's past, present and future.""We have over three million Turkish people in Germany ... and they can also identify with me. We are an idol club for many immigrant clubs,"" the sharply trimmed midfielder Tosun says.   Beaming with pride as he describes playing for Türkgücü in his hometown of Munich, Tosun recounts receiving messages on Instagram from supporters in Turkey who he says ""look up to us.""    ""We're not the typical local club,"" adds Türkgücü CEO Max Kothny. ""If I look in the stands, there's so many people from so many cultures that it perfectly shows how the German culture is.""The club's logo is half-half of the Turkish and Bavarian flags'The higher you go, the harder it gets'   Türkgücü's increased prominence -- both on and off the pitch -- owes itself, in part, to its rapid rise through the German football league structure.      Once an amateur team, Türkgücü now plays in the 3. Liga -- Germany's third division, which like the country's top two leagues is fully professional.Remarkably Türkgücü now stands just two promotions away from Germany's elite league -- the Bundesliga. According to Der Spiegel in March 2020, the club's budget was $2 million. Türkgücü wouldn't confirm that figure, but did say it's ""in the lower half  in the table regarding the budgets in 3. Liga.""""The higher you go, the harder it gets,"" Kothny says with a wry smile.     Financial backing for the team has been largely provided by Hasan Kivran, a Turkish-born German, who previously played for the club, but is now a   successful business entrepreneur and Türkgücü's president. Türkgücü wouldn't disclose how much Kivran has invested in the club.""Being ambitious is not something bad -- it's something good,"" says Zinsou. ""Following your goals is something good. Taking smart decisions to reach this goal is something good. Working with passion is something good.""    Kivran intimated he was going to step down in late 2020, but then had a rethink.   ""The main reasons that I changed my mind were those in charge of the company, a high level of fan support over the past two weeks and the prospect of a young talent center in southeast Munich,"" said Kivran in an interview with SPORT1 earlier this year. Croatian striker Petar Sliskovic is one of a number of new arrivals at the clubMunich's second team?     Türkgücü is currently ninth in Germany's 3. Liga with 40 points, 18 behind leader Dynamo Dresden.    Germany's third division contains a number of clubs  -- such as 1. FC Kaiserslautern and TSV 1860 München --- that have previously played in the Bundesliga.That Türkgücü now plays against such clubs -- 1. FC Kaiserslautern is a four-time winner of the German top-flight league  --  is testament to its rise through the German football ladder and its growing prominence.   ""We've been working here since the sixth division, which is absolutely incredible!"" Kothny says speaking to CNN Sport from a 15 square meter wooden portacabin that acts as the club's offices.      ""This is a total start-up mentality,"" he adds.    Kothny says plans are afoot to build the club's own academy and training facilities, but for now this football start-up is currently without a stadium to call home.   'Home' matches are divided between the Grünwalder and the iconic Munich Olympic Stadium, one of the venues for the 1972 Olympic Games.     Playing at the Olympic Stadium -- Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich's former home before the club moved to the Allianz Arena -- Kothny and Tosun say they have to pinch themselves at times to remember the journey they've been on.     ""Now we're playing in an arena which has 60,000 seats -- it's brilliant!"" Kothny exclaims.     ""There are so many good players who played there. They are so many important matches played there -- It's an honor,"" Tosun says.    Türkgücü are playing some of their home matches this season at the iconic Olympic Stadium, venue of the 1972 Munich Olympics Remodel and rebuild     Perhaps what's surprising is not just that Kothny is spearheading operations from relatively modest surroundings but that he's doing so at the age of 24.    ""I think the future is on the young guns so I'm using it as an advantage,"" smiles Kothny.     ""My way of thinking is a little bit different to the rest of this business, which is pretty much the same for the last like 20 years,"" adds Kothny, explaining how each season ""we lose 80% of the roster"" to ensure Türkgücü is competitive, given each promotion means the club will play against better teams.   Tosun joined the club in 2018, yet he's its longest-serving player and one of the few Turkish-German players left in the squad.""We need to keep that factor in the history, in the portfolio of the club,"" says Zinsou.    ""I mean, if there were somewhere a Togolese team playing in a high level, I would be very interested in joining them as well,' Zinsou says jokingly.     ""Bavarian nowadays doesn't only mean that you have a German name [...] because the culture in Munich is mixed and it is rich.     ""Our main focus is clearly on the quality of the players with the target to bring them to the first team,"" added Zinsou.    Over the last few years there has been a huge turnover of players with the aim of achieving direct promotion to 3. Liga, which signals thet scale of Türkgücü's ambition.    ""That brought a lot of criticism also on us but this is how it worked. And I think the success proves that that this was the right way,"" says Kothny.Turkish-born German Ünal Tosun is Türkgücü's longest-serving playerFighting fear through football     Nonetheless Türkgücü's ascent and the club's strong Turkish associations have drawn plenty of attention.    Inspiring and imaginative to some; divisive and disruptive to others, the club has become a target of  some far-right groups in Germany.   The extreme-right Der III. Weg -- The Third Way -- party, has been vocal about Türkgücü.   According to the German Interior Ministry, the ""ideological statements of the party ""The III. Way"" are shaped from historical National Socialism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia.""The far-right group's website in October showed a photo of two men, one holding The Third Way flag, displaying a ""Türkgücü is not welcome"" banner outside Zwickau's stadium.Underneath the photo was the statement, ""Whether in Zwickau, Magdeburg or anywhere else: a Turkish team has no place in German football. The message is clear in Magdeburg and among fans of the FCM: Türkgücü is not welcome.""   ""We were unfortunately already prepared as far as we knew that things like that might happen,"" Kothny says. ""Sometimes it is a burden to have the Turkish flag in your logo.     ""A lot of [users on] social media are saying go back to Turkey or play in the Super Lig, but they are not realizing the background,"" adds Kothny, referring to the Turkish top-flight soccer division.He also recounts how small groups of far-right supporters gathered ahead of the away game against FSV Zwickau in October in Saxony. And when Türkgücü played 1. FC Kaiserslautern in January, racist and xenophobic stickers and flyers were put up in the vicinity of the Fritz Walter Stadium.  The club's recent rapid rise has seen it targeted by far-right supportersBoth FSV Zwickau and 1. FC Kaiserslautern took to social media to stand in solidarity with Türkgücü.   And Rainer Keßler, chairman of the supervisory board of 1. FC Kaiserslautern, said in a statement: ""It is intolerable that right-wing groups try to misuse 1. FC Kaiserslautern's name, history, values and the Fritz-Walter-Stadion in the defense of inhuman slogans and ideologies. The FCK family stands for a multicultural society and expressly distances itself from nationalist ideas."" Meanwhile, in another game against SV Waldhof Mannheim in April 2020, Türkgücü player Yi-Young Park reportedly told the referee that he had been repeatedly racially insulted from the spectator area.Mannheim was subsequently fined $2,900  by the German Football Association (DFB) for the behavior of its fans.Kothny admits that messages at those games are ""not the most brutal thing that I've read on a banner. We get letters from people all around Germany here to our post box. We get emails which are brutal, which is really like far right things against the club.""    Despite the wider political landscape, Kothny says he is adamant that the club has to maintain its neutrality.      ""We try not to give those people a platform [...] because then they get exactly what they want and this is awareness.    ""We try to always give the answer on the pitch because this is what counts in sports. As soon as we move in one political direction, this will not turn out well for us.""     Integration    The philosophy of Türkgücü's youth setup -- the club has five youth teams, which Zinsou oversees, emphasizes the teaching of life as much as soccer skills.""This is a package for life, it's not only for football,"" says Zinsou, as he talks about Türkgücü's various youth teams.   ""When you talk about integration, it's always on both parts. I need to go one step further and people will do a step in my direction so that we meet somewhere in the middle.""     That message is one shared by Claudemir Jeronimo Barreto, known as Cacau, the Brazil-born former Germany international who played for Türkgücu, and was integration officer for the DFB until January.While working for the DFB, Cacau was active in supporting the organization's work with refugees. According to the DFB, a scheme the association set up enabled 60,000 refugees to play football competitively in German.In the summer of 2019, Cacau also traveled to Ostritz at the invitation of the local football club and worked alongside Michael Kretschmer -- Minister-President of the Free State of Saxony -- against a right-wing extremist rallyTosun is hoping that he too can deliver a lasting legacy for generations to come.     ""I want to be a role model with my mentality. I want to be a role model for younger players and want to help [them] achieve the same goal that I achieve,"" as he reflected on his career and the example he wants to set.John Sinnott contributed to this report"

Chinaza Onuzo, co-founder of Inkblot Productions, the studio behind domestic hits ""The Wedding Party"" and ""Up North,"" told CNN Business the company has signed a three-year licensing deal running through to 2024. The deal will see Inkblot's upcoming releases move onto Amazon's platform after showing in cinemas. ""This allows us to plan long-term,"" Onuzo says. Instead of film-by-film commissioning, the company is looking at possible intellectual property deals and franchise potential in Inkblot's existing titles. ""It has given us the opportunity to broaden the genres that we explore (and) given us the opportunity to work with a with a wider mix of filmmakers and talents,"" he adds.Anthill Studios produces original features and animation, releasing titles including ""Prophetess"" and ""Day of Destiny"" (the latter a co-production with Inkblot). Its films will also appear on Prime Video after a theatrical window, in a multi-year agreement.Read More""We jumped at the deal,"" says founder and creative director Niyi Akinmolayan. ""We've practically doubled the size of our budgets ... we've become a lot more ambitious with the kind of stories we want to tell.""What the deals will do for studios and cinemasNigeria's film industry, nicknamed ""Nollywood,"" produces thousands of movies every year and the country's entertainment and media market is projected to have double-digit growth between 2021 and 2025, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.Amazon's deal with Inkblot in December 2021 was the first of its kind to be struck between the streaming giant, which has 200 million subscribers, and an African studio. The Anthill deal followed a month later.Niyi Akinmolayan, founder of Anthill Studios, has directed some of Nollywood's highest-grossing films.Anthill's Akinmolayan, also a film director, says Amazon has been hands off so far. ""They're not telling you the kind of films to make,"" he says. ""They have zero input on creativity -- that's very appealing to any filmmaker.""This is intentional, Amazon suggests. ""We believe that if Nollywood filmmakers focus on telling compelling, authentic, hyper-local and universally accessible stories -- that are grounded in the rich history, lived experiences and culture of Nigeria -- those stories will travel and will engage audiences around the world,"" said Ayanna Lonian, director of content acquisition and head of worldwide major studio licensing strategy at Amazon Prime Video, in an email to CNN.Lonian says the aim is to both diversify Prime Video's offering to its global audience and make the platform a more appealing product for Nigerian audiences.Netflix first original series from Nigeria drops highly anticipated trailerAmazon does not share subscriber figures for individual countries. Akinmolayan believes the Nigerian diaspora will be the primary beneficiary of the new content, explaining that awareness of the subscription service in Nigeria was not high. ""Very few people know that they can actually download the Amazon app and pay for it here,"" he says, ""that's because Amazon hasn't fully unleashed a plan for (the service).""In the meantime, the deals could have an impact on domestic cinemas.Anthill's deal involves separate licenses for each film, the value of which is determined in part by the film's theatrical box office. This is an incentive to ""build cinema culture,"" Akinmolayan argues.""Even though it feels to a lot of people that (streaming) platforms are coming to kill cinemas, in this case they will probably do the reverse and actually encourage people to make more for cinema,"" he says.Nancy Isime in Inkblot Productions' 2021 film ""Superstar.""Onuzo says the share of box office for Nigerian films in domestic cinemas has risen in recent years, but foreign-made blockbusters still dominate receipts. He describes Inkblot's audience as ""both discerning and forgiving,"" given the huge budget disparities between homegrown titles and foreign movies.""You have to deliver entertainment that is on a commensurate scale to what Hollywood films are doing,"" he explains. ""You can't meet the spectacle, but you can meet the truth: what it means to be a Nigerian; what it means for people to see themselves on screen ... That is something that, no matter what their budget is, (no) Hollywood title can compete (with)."" That said, ""when you're a Nigerian film and you're competing with a Marvel film, you can only pray,"" jokes Akinmolayan.The next chapterThe next stage of Prime Video's move into the African market is already underway. Lonian said discussions on developing and commissioning Amazon Originals -- series or films produced or co-produced by Amazon -- were taking place with producers and talent. ""We attended the African International Film Festival (AFRIFF) in November to start really meaningful engagement with the production industry in Africa,"" she added. ""Our message is that we're very much open for business.""Akinmolayan behind the camera on a recent production.For Anthill and Inkblot, their immediate focus is on their upcoming slates. Onuzo says Inkblot has seven films in various stages from production, while Akinmolayan names crime drama ""The Man for the Job,"" a romantic comedy, and an ""X-Men""-style superhero movie among Anthill's future titles.""We are very excited, because we feel that there's a significant opportunity for Nigerian and African filmmakers to fully engage with the world over the next three to five years,"" says Onuzo. ""It's a good time to be an African content creator."""

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN)""It's very emotional for me because I see European people with blue eyes and blonde hair being killed."" These were the words of Ukraine's Deputy Chief Prosecutor, David Sakvarelidze, during a recent BBC interview about the Russian invasion of Ukraine.It wasn't so much what he said, it was more what was implied; that not all lives have equal value. And that idea -- the belief that some races are superior to others -- is a fundamental principle of racism. It's alarming to me that Sakvarelidze was left unchallenged during his interview.  As a Black, African woman without the benefit of blue eyes or blonde hair, it's been equally emotional to see the number of racist and ignorant comments in the coverage on Ukraine that have passed unchallenged by the interviewers and media platforms that have aired them. CBS, Aljazeera, France's BFM TV and ITV have all reported the invasion in ways that illustrate deep bias, informed by a belief system that screams of an old-world, White-led, order. ITV News correspondent Lucy Watson on ITV reporting back to the studio summed up the collective hypocrisy and underlying narrative that the Ukrainian war has exposed when she said: ""The unthinkable has happened...this is not a developing, third-world nation; this is Europe!""We can't ignore the darker sides of global unity on war in UkraineAccording to the narrative she believes, ""unthinkable things"" happen only in ""third world nations"" (now an outdated and derogatory term, someone should tell her), and that narrative is perpetuated by the type of stories she and many like her, have heard about the continent. Read MoreIn Africa, it's the stories of conflict in Ethiopia, insurgency in Mozambique, election violence in Uganda, and the recent coups in Mali, Chad, Guinea, Sudan, Burkina Faso and Guinea Bissau. But it's clear that far too many are not paying attention to them because the people in these stories are not rich or from the Global North. It's the reason why the 'unthinkable things' that happen in places like Africa are typically reported in terms of issues, numbers and trends -- rather than the people, the emotions and the lives destroyed. In Africa our stories tend to offer simplistic analysis that lacks context and nuance, and prioritizes headline-grabbing proclamations, like this one from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres about an ""an epidemic of coup d'états"" in response to the six coups in five out of 54 African countries over an 18-month period.   These examples have shown us that global media is complicit in perpetuating racist narratives, by not encouraging diversity in its newsrooms and giving an unrestricted platform to reporters and influential spokespeople with implicit biases that are left unchallenged. But rather than dwelling on this, I want to share some of the facts that should make us all rethink the traditional and stereotypical ways we dismiss non-White, non-rich countries and their people. The traditional world order is undergoing a dramatic shift, driven by Covid-19, China, Russia, and movements like #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter. The new world order is providing an opportunity for the world to rethink the little they know about the rest of the world.  By 2050, Nigeria will overtake the United States as the world's third-most-populous country with a population of 400 million people. That's one reason enough to pay attention. Africa's population is growing rapidly and experts predict it will account for half the world's people growth in the next two decades. This means that more than a quarter of the world's population will be on just one continent -- Africa. The thought that the world will be overrun by Africans (no blue eyes or blonde hair here) will be an uncomfortable idea for some people, especially if they are unaware of the roughly 125,000 millionaires, 6,200 multimillionaires, 275 centimillionaires, and 22 billionaires that exist on the continent today. As the granddaughter and daughter of Jews who escaped Kyiv, I cannot remain silent nowIndeed, a report by the University of Southern California in 2019, highlighted how poorly Africa is depicted in the US. It also revealed that Americans seldom see mentions of Africa or Africans on TV entertainment shows or in the news. When they do, the portrayals are often negative and stereotyped. According to the report, most mentions of Africa (43%) appeared on national or local news and tended to be 'hard' news stories which often fed the stereotype. After politics (32%), crime received the most mentions (16%), while business and the economy accounted for just 8% of news coverage.  Over 60 research papers, reports, books, academic journals that we analyzed from the year 2000 written on Africa in the media told us that poverty, conflict, corruption, disease and poor leadership were the five frames through which most stories are told about Africa. This persistent portrayal of a single story is the reason why over the years, Africans have fought back with hashtags like #TheAfricaTheMediaNeverShowsYou  and #SomeoneTellCNN over a 2015 CNN report describing Kenya as a ""hotbed of terror,"" for which it later amended. And organizations like Africa No Filter, which set out to shift stereotypical narratives about Africa, were created.  It's the reason why the Twittersphere erupted recently when journalist Alan Macleod put together his greatest hits of racist coverage of the Ukraine invasion -- thank you, Alan! Contrary to what negative media portrayals might have you believe, Africa actually has some of the world's fastest-growing economies. For example, to most of the world, Rwanda is synonymous with its 1994 genocide. But with an average GDP growth predicted of 6.7 between 2021-2025, it is in the top five of the fastest-growing economies alongside India. Rwanda has been able to attract foreign direct investment and is one of the easiest places to do business in Africa (after Mauritius) according to a World Bank index. This means Rwanda and countries like Seychelles, Mauritius, Ivory Coast, Ghana and Kenya are worth considering as potential destinations for investment, not just development dollars. 'He has decided to destroy the whole world': Six global voices on Putin's invasion of UkraineDon't ignore the data that shows that there are more than 400 companies that earn annual revenues of $1 billion or more in Africa, or that the second fastest-growing tourism market in the world is right here in Africa.  It's also unlikely that many in the Global North will know any of this because it doesn't fit the narrative both have been fed about non-white, 'third world countries.'The fastest-growing developer community and tech start-up ecosystem in the world is in Africa. Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania are ranked in the top 20 Global Crypto Adoption Index. This means they have some of the highest grass-roots adoptions of cryptocurrencies in the world. In fact, Kenya has been ranked first in the world when it comes to peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions. Given all this digital activity, it is hardly surprising that Africa is one of the fastest-growing markets in terms of venture capital activities and financial technology. Africa is also regarded as the world's second-fastest-growing and profitable payments and banking market after Latin America, according to this McKinsey study.The reality is that much of what is happening in Africa today is unexpected. For example, six countries; Namibia, Cape Verde, Ghana, South Africa, Burkina Faso, and Botswana have a higher Press Freedom Index rating than the USA, according to Reporters Without Borders.But that doesn't fit the persistent image of a broken continent where nothing works, and where its sad, dependent people lack agency to make a change. The truth is there is new dynamic energy and entrepreneurial spirit on the continent which is a story that is largely untold, and its evidenced by the low esteem with which those in the Global North hold us.  Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookIt's a story that is hidden because its heroes are neither White, nor do they hail from 'up there.'

It's the stuff of entrepreneurial dreams, and yet that's what's happened to Opibus, a Swedish-Kenyan electric mobility company.Based in Nairobi, Opibus gives new life to old vehicles by converting them to run on electric motors. Beginning with 4x4s, the company's reach has since expanded into public transport with bus conversions. Meanwhile, its electric motorbikes, designed and manufactured in Kenya, have attracted the attention of the world's most famous ride-hailing app.This Nigerian tech startup is fighting baby jaundice with solar-powered cribs Opibus has roots as research by Linköping University students Filip Gardler, Mikael Gånge and Filip Lövström, whose project involved identifying places where electric mobility could have the largest possible impact. They pinpointed Kenya and established Opibus in 2017, starting their business by converting safari touring vehicles.""We've always known the commercial potential (of electric conversion),"" CEO Lövström says, adding it was easy to convince safari tour operators of the benefits of silent 4x4s that are driven on circular routes and return to the same recharging point.Read MoreSince then, Opibus has converted 4x4s for use in mining and other utility roles. The process is not cheap: prices start at just under $40,000 to convert a Toyota Land Cruiser and Land Rover, a 10-to-14-day process involving parts sourced from all over the world, says Lövström. But, he argues, the benefits outweigh the expense, and that much of the cost -- along with the carbon footprint of the conversion -- are recouped in the running of the electric vehicle (EV).Opibus say it has motorcycle pilots underway in Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda.Why Kenya is primed for electric vehiclesKenya, East Africa's largest economy and a country where over 90% of domestically-produced electricity comes from renewable sources, presents a strong platform for clean electric mobility. Internet blimps are coming to Zanzibar. But can a UK company succeed where Google failed? Fransua Vytautas Razvadauskas, mobility and cities senior consultant at market research company Euromonitor International, cites high prices as a barrier to entry, but so too infrastructure. ""For the EV rollout to be successful (in Kenya), a large supply of charging units -- both public and private -- are needed to prevent range anxiety. This will, in turn, demand large investments in the upgrade of electricity distribution units, at homes and businesses,"" he explains.Using electric vehicles for public transport overcomes range anxiety and charging infrastructure issues to a degree. A bus operator knows how many miles it will travel in a day, what route and where it will stop, and charging units can be planned accordingly. Opibus began a pilot for its 51-seater electric bus in January. The company installed off-grid solar powered charging points to top up the bus' batteries.In January, Opibus began an electric bus pilot in Nairobi, installing off-grid solar power stations to charge its batteries (the company sells a range of off-grid solar modules and batteries -- a clean energy source but also indicative of Kenya's history of blackouts). The 51-passenger vehicle hasn't been tested commercially yet, but the company plans to do so later this year.Lövström believes that with a fast-growing population in sub-Saharan Africa and rapidly expanding cities, buses will be a vital part of the region's infrastructure. ""We really think that electric buses are a huge part of how to create this transition to electric vehicles, and how to reduce emissions on both a city and global level,"" he says.Opibus plans to manufacture the bus for a Pan-African market in 2023. It also has competition. Another Kenya-based startup, BasiGo, has announced it plans to start its own electric bus pilot program in March.A revolution on two wheels?Opibus' motorcycle has a range of up to 200 kilometers (124 miles) and a top speed of 90 kilometers per hour (56 miles per hour).Razvadauskas identifies the ""largest opportunity"" for EVs in East Africa as two- and three-wheeled vehicles, because they are cheaper and more popular than cars.""In 2021, Kenya was home to 1.8 million motorcycles and mopeds compared with 1.2 million passenger cars -- a tendency that is analogous in other regional countries such as Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda,"" Razvadauskas says.Why Africa is sending more satellites into spaceOpibus is looking to corner the market through its Kenya-made electric motorbike.The company decided to design its model from scratch because no existing motorcycles matched local users' needs, says Lövström. ""We need something that is very strong, very versatile, very robust, easy to repair and cheap at the same time,"" he explains.""Almost 90% of the motorcycles are built and designed locally,"" says Lucy Mugala, a research and development engineer who helped create the motorbike. ""(Electric vehicle manufacturing) is quite new in this county, so we are sort of pioneers."" She says the motorcycle has evolved from having a single onboard battery to two removable batteries, which use a portable charger that can plug into any socket. In the near future, Mugala says docking stations packed with charged batteries could be a feature in cities, like today's petrol stations.The bike comes with a detachable battery (either single or dual) meaning fully-charged batteries can be swapped in in a matter of minutes.Prices start at $1,400 for the motorcycle, which has a range of up to 200 kilometers (124 miles) and a top speed of 90 kilometers per hour (56 miles per hour). It enters a competitive market dominated by petrol motorcycles from Indian and Chinese manufacturers including Bajaj Auto and Haojun. Lövström concedes that Opibus' electric motorcycle is currently ""a few hundred dollars more"" than conventional motorcycles. In December, Opibus announced a strategic partnership with Uber as part of the ride-hailing company's aim to be fully electric by 2040. Opibus will supply 3,000 motorcycles this year and is working with a financing partner for Uber drivers to own the electric motorcycles for commercial use.The company has sold 150 units to date and plans to produce 12,000 motorcycles in 2023. Outside Kenya, Opibus has motorcycle trials with different partners in Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda. ""Expanding to other markets is definitely going to be a plus for us,"" Mugala says, ""but more so (is) bringing the cost of our electric motorbikes down as low as possible."" Plans for expansionThe Swedish-Kenyan company received a $7.5 million round of investment in November 2021. CEO and co-founder Filip Lövström told CNN investment has come from all over the world, including Silicon Valley and the African continent.Opibus received significant backing in the form of a $7.5 million round of investment in November 2021. ""This has really accelerated our mission to scale up production,"" Mugala says, with the company intending to expand its 100-strong staff and its manufacturing space to meet its growing output.Opibus has ambitions to establish regional hubs, but Kenya will continue as its base of operation -- a country where senior staff from Sweden have been living for around five years already.  ""We always knew that there were massive opportunities,"" says Lövström. ""That is very hard to understand when you're not there. You need to be on the ground.""""(Globally, there are) 150 to 200 million new vehicle sales per year, but we have 1.2 billion vehicles in the world already,"" he says of the opportunity electric retrofitting represents. ""We need to do something if we are to reach our targets of having green electric fleets across the world."""

Many cases are mild and resolve on their own, but more serious cases require phototherapy, where babies are placed under blue light. It's a simple, effective treatment -- but in some places, including Oboro's home country of Nigeria, access to the necessary equipment isn't always possible. Not getting treatment can lead to irreversible health problems including hearing loss, vision impairment, brain damage and cerebral palsy. In rare cases, it can lead to death. Tombra's case was severe, but there were no phototherapy units available and the family waited four hours while his condition deteriorated. Eventually, he was given an emergency blood transfusion -- a risky surgery that bought valuable time until a phototherapy unit became available. Oboro says she had to buy the bulb herself, and power outages meant the unit was off for several hours during Tombra's seven-day treatment.Virtue Oboro, pictured, co-founded Tiny Hearts with her husband after their own traumatizing experience with neonatal jaundice.Read MoreDespite the many obstacles, her son, now six, made a full recovery. But Oboro says the experience was traumatizing -- and it inspired her to change careers. Driven by a new mission to save babies from jaundice, she created the Crib A'Glow: a portable, affordable, solar-powered phototherapy unit, which treats jaundice using blue LED lights. ""I felt like some of the things (I experienced) could have been avoided, or the stress level could be reduced,"" she says. ""I thought, is there something I could do to make the pain less for the babies and the mothers?""Power cuts and broken bulbsJaundice is caused by a build-up in the blood of bilirubin -- a yellow compound produced when red blood cells break down. Bilirubin is usually removed by the liver, but newborns' livers are often not developed enough to do this effectively. The blue light helps to make the bilirubin easier for the liver to break down.





""One can find large numbers of obsolete or dysfunctional systems being applied at some of these centers (in Nigeria).""Hippolite Amadi, neonatal specialist


Oboro's experience with power outages and broken equipment isn't uncommon in Nigeria, says Hippolite Amadi, a professor of bioengineering at Imperial College, London, who specializes in neonatal medicine and has worked with neonatal centers in Nigeria for over 20 years.Parents often have to travel long distances to get to a hospital, not all of which have phototherapy units and neonatal specialists, says Amadi. ""One can find large numbers of obsolete or dysfunctional systems being applied at some of these centers,"" he says, adding that by his estimates, ""less than 5% of all Nigerian facilities has sufficient functional phototherapy devices"" to serve needy patients. Crib A'Glow is powered with solar energy and folds flat so it's easy to move.This increases the likelihood of a negative outcome: it has been reported that in low and middle income countries, infants are 27 times more likely to suffer from brain damage caused by jaundice, and 119 times more likely to die compared to high income nations. An affordable cureOboro founded her company Tiny Hearts in 2016, shortly after Tombra's recovery, and began developing the phototherapy cribs. As a visual designer, Oboro says she struggled with the medical technicalities. However, her husband had experience working with solar energy and was on hand to help. Oboro also worked with a pediatrician to make sure the device was safe and in line with current phototherapy guidelines. 





""I felt like some of the things (I experienced) could have been avoided, or the stress level could be reduced. I thought, is there something I could do to make the pain less for the babies and the mothers?""Virtue Oboro, founder, Tiny Hearts


According to Amadi, one of the most effective phototherapy units currently used in Nigeria costs around $2,000, a steep sum for hospitals on a budget. But Crib A'Glow -- produced in Nigeria using local materials -- is able to save on added fees like import tax, and retails for $360 per unit. Additionally, because it's portable and solar powered, the device can be used at home by parents living in remote areas with limited or inconsistent access to electricity.Oboro and her team, including pediatricians and healthcare workers, are now developing protective eyewear for babies to use in the phototherapy units.""Seeing devices coming out that will solve that problem is very exciting,"" says Amadi, adding that he would be interested in testing the technology in the practices he oversees. He says innovations like Crib A'Glow could be used in tandem with conventional phototherapy machines, allowing babies to begin jaundice treatment in a hospital and to finish at home. ""Such technology needs to be supported and production scaled up to tackle neonatal conditions in Nigeria,"" he adds.An award-winning designThe Crib A'Glow innovation has received award grants including $50,000 from Johnson and Johnson's Africa Innovation Award. Most recently, the device was selected as a finalist for the Royal Academy of Engineering's Africa Prize 2022. Tiny Hearts isn't the only company trying to improve the treatment of neonatal jaundice. In the US, Little Sparrows Technologies has created the portable ""BiliHut"" which also uses high-intensity LEDs and allows for at-home treatment, while in India, D-Rev and Phoenix Medical Systems came up with a low-cost phototherapy light stand for emerging markets. 





""It was not an easy thing to get them to test the unit, because the perception was if it was made in Nigeria, it probably would not work well.""Virtue Oboro, founder, Tiny Hearts


While the Crib A'Glow might seem like an ingenious solution, Oboro says she has faced resistance from hospitals and medical professionals in Nigeria. ""It was not an easy thing to get them to test the unit, because the perception was if it was made in Nigeria, it probably would not work well,"" she says. Despite these barriers, the cribs are already being used by more than 500 hospitals across Nigeria and Ghana, treating over 300,000 babies, says Oboro, and the company is hoping to expand into other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. She says a further 200,000 babies have been helped through their collaborations with rural health workers and education programs, teaching mothers about the symptoms of jaundice -- most commonly yellowing of the skin, whites of the eyes and mouth. Demand for the cribs has soared during the Covid-19 pandemic, says Oboro, as many parents wanted to avoid hospitals and look after their newborns at home. The team is working on protective eye wear, to blindfold babies safely during phototherapy. Oboro says she feels ""lucky and grateful"" that Tombra survived -- and now it's her mission to fight neonatal jaundice, and ""save a hundred and one more babies."""

How the war in Ukraine could hit Africa,"Abuja, Nigeria (CNN Business)As Russian troops tear through Ukraine, swathes of Africa are gearing up to bear the brunt of a potentially drawn-out conflict between the ex-Soviet republics — two of some of the continent's most cherished trading partners.African economists sound the alarm over a looming and likely catastrophic lowering of trade volumes between the continent and its warring partners if Russia's widely condemned incursion into Ukraine isn't short-lived.Russia and Ukraine are key players in the global agricultural trade, with both nations accounting for a quarter of the world's wheat exports, including at least 14 percent of corn exports in 2020, and a joint 58 percent of global sunflower oil exports in the same year, analysis show.Trade between African countries and the former Soviet neighbors, especially Russia, has flourished in recent years with Russian exports to the continent valued at $14 billion annually, and imports from Africa pegged at around $5 billion per year.Russian President Vladimir Putin (C) gestures as Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi (L) and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa (R) pose for a family photo with African countries leaders attending 2019 Russia-Africa Summit and Economic Forum in Sochi on October 24, 2019.But these gains are on the verge of eroding quickly, analysts worry, signaling a severe disruption in Africa's food conditions if Russia's military operation in Ukraine persists.Read More'Three months away from hunger'Parts of Africa could be plunged into hunger in as fast as three months if Russia's invasion of Ukraine lingers, says Wandile Sihlobo, the Chief Economist of the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa.""In the short term, between now and three months, the conflict will affect food supply primarily from a pricing perspective,"" Sihlobo told CNN.""As net importers of products like wheat, which influences bread and cereals, sunflower oil and maize, African countries are fairly exposed on some of these supplies that are coming out of Russia and Ukraine. There will be challenges if the war continues for more than three months — because ordinarily, countries usually keep stock of supplies for three to five months.""Sihlobo explains that the Ukraine war also comes at a bad time for Africa given the current experience of a severe drought in its eastern subregion, which has taken a hit on food prices.""Food prices are already high now. If the war stretches, there will be millions of Africans that will be in hunger. We are already expecting millions of people to be in hunger in the areas affected by the drought, so the ongoing conflict will worsen that,"" he said.Battle moves into Kyiv as Ukrainians fight to keep control of their capitalAfrica's biggest economies such as Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa, Algeria, and Kenya are major importers of Russia's agricultural exports, putting them at risk of further spikes in food prices if trade is disrupted.Sihlobo adds that sanctions targeted at Russia could also complicate Africa's exports.""Africa exports fruits and vegetables to Russia and Ukraine. Seven percent of South Arica's citrus goes to Russia, 14 percent of South Africa's apples and pears goes to Russia. Egypt and Tunisia also export fruits and vegetables to Russia. The challenge with all of these countries is that with all of the sanctions that are placed on Russia by the US and European countries, it influences the financial services sector... even if the logistics will not be immediately affected, it will disrupt the payment system to all of the exporting countries to Russia,"" he told CNN.Development economist Ndumiso Hadebe agrees that ""Africa is likely to see disturbances in the supply chains that pertain to goods and services that are exported and imported between Russia and Africa"" as Russia is slammed with a barrage of sanctions by critics of its Ukraine invasion.Taking sides on the conflictHadebe tells CNN that Africa's largely muted response towards the Russia - Ukraine conflict may cave in for a more direct stance on parties involved in the war if fighting intensifies.Only a handful of governments on the continent have spoken out in the aftermath of the attacks, with the African Union urging Russia's respect for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.""There will be significant pressure from a multilateral relations point of view as African countries may be forced to take a position on the conflict that is happening between Russia and Ukraine, and that may either adversely or positively affect the relationship between Africa and Russia going forward,"" Hadebe says.For Russian academic, Irina Filatova, taking sides won't benefit Africa.""It won't be in Africa's benefit to take sides. I think that Africa can try to remain neutral,"" said Filatova, who specializes in Russian and African history.Beyond agriculture, Russia is expanding its influence in African states troubled with insurgency by providing alternative military solutions from those offered by its Western counterparts, which are often determined by human rights considerations.Russia has signed up to 20 military cooperation agreements in Africa, including deals with Nigeria and Ethiopia, two of Africa's most populous countries.Russian mercenaries have continually come under allegations of human rights infractions in the Central African Republic and other parts of Africa where they were contracted by regional governments to combat local rebels.'It was our children they killed'However, Russia has denied links to private military contractors such as the Wagner Group, which is accused of the abuses.Hadebe told CNN that arms trade is ""one of the key features that have defined the trade relationship between Russia and Africa.""""Russia is the largest exporter of weapons to sub-Saharan Africa in particular.""Africa accounted for 18 percent of Russian arms exports between 2016 and 2020, according to data by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.According to Filatova, Russia's prospects of doubling down on its interests in Africa may be higher in the aftermath of the Ukraine war.""Russia will be much more interested in maintaining relations with African countries than it was until now... It has already started to develop these relations but in the situation of the global isolation by the western world, it will definitely try to maintain relations with Africa,"" she told CNN."

""In the unfolding emergency, there have been disturbing reports about the racist treatment of Africans and people of African descent seeking to flee Ukraine to safety. The media is covering these appalling incidents and several states have confirmed that their citizens are suffering such treatment. We strongly condemn this racism and believe that it is damaging to the spirit of solidarity that is so urgently needed today. ""The mistreatment of African peoples on Europe's borders needs to cease immediately, whether to the Africans fleeing Ukraine or to those crossing the Mediterranean,"" Kenyan Ambassador to the UN Martin Kimani said Monday.The African Union has said it is ""disturbed"" by the reports of segregation against Africans in Ukraine, which it described as ""shockingly racist.""Foreign students fleeing Ukraine say they face segregation, racism at border""Reports that Africans are singled out for unacceptable dissimilar treatment would be shockingly racist and in breach international law,"" a statement by the AU said Monday.The 54 member bloc urged countries to ""show the same empathy and support to all people fleeing war notwithstanding their racial identity.""Kimani added that the Security Council needs ""to be able to understand that there are actors who want to magnify this story for cynical reasons that have nothing to do with the wellbeing and safety of Africans."" He also thanked Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia for allowing Kenyan citizens fleeing Ukraine visa-free entry into their countries.  Ghanaian Deputy Ambassador to the UN Carolyn Oppong-Ntiri echoed the sentiment in her remarks, calling for the facilitation of persons fleeing Ukraine ""without discrimination"" and to provide them with humanitarian assistance, ""including medical care in line with the principles of humanity, neutrality, and impartiality.""Read MoreThe UN Ambassador from Gabon called reports of racism ""unacceptable.""""We ask for the respect of the dignity and for equitable treatment of all people in dire circumstances.

""Our borders were not of our own drawing. They were drawn in the distant colonial metropoles of London, Paris and Lisbon, with no regard for the ancient nations that they cleaved apart.""The sanctions that could really hurt Russia Kenya, which had been under British rule since 1895, was named an official colony in 1920 and remained that way until it won independence in 1963.""At independence, had we chosen to pursue states on the basis of ethnic, racial or religious homogeneity, we would still be waging bloody wars these many decades later,"" he said.Read More""Instead, we agreed that we would settle for the borders that we inherited, but we would still pursue continental political, economic and legal integration. Rather than form nations that looked ever backward into history with a dangerous nostalgia, we chose to look forward to a greatness none of our many nations and peoples had ever known.""Kimani drew the comparisons in an address to the U.N. Security Council.He continued: ""We believe that all states formed from empires that have collapsed or retreated have many peoples in them yearning for integration with peoples in neighboring states. This is normal and understandable. After all, who does not want to be joined to their brethren and to make common purpose with them?""However, Kenya rejects such a yearning from being pursued by force. We must complete our recovery from the embers of dead empires in a way that does not plunge us back into new forms of domination and oppression,"" he said.

","africa, Why are coups making a comeback in Africa?  - CNN",Why are coups making a comeback in Africa? ,"Remi Adekoya is a political analyst and Associate Lecturer at York University. (CNN)In just over a year, Africa has experienced three successful coups (two in Mali and one more recently in Guinea), one unsuccessful coup attempt in Niger, and an arbitrary military transfer of power in Chad following the assassination of its president. These power grabs threaten a reversal of the democratization process Africa has undergone in the past two decades and a return to the era of coups as the norm. According to one study, sub-Saharan Africa experienced 80 successful coups and 108 failed coup attempts between 1956 and 2001, an average of four a year. This figure halved in the period from then till 2019 as most African nations turned to democracy, only for it to once again be on the ascendance. Why?Different decade, same problemsIn the early postcolonial decades when coups were rampant, Africa's coup leaders virtually always offered the same reasons for toppling governments: corruption, mismanagement, poverty. Read MoreThe leader of Guinea's recent coup, Colonel Mamady Doumbouya, echoed these justifications, citing ""poverty and endemic corruption"" as reasons for overthrowing 83 year old president Alpha Conde. The soldiers who led a coup in neighbouring Mali last year claimed ""theft"" and ""bad governance"" prompted their actions. Likewise, the Sudanese and Zimbabwean generals who toppled Omar al-Bashir in 2019 and Robert Mugabe in 2017 respectively, deployed similar arguments.  Guinean military officer says President Alpha Conde arrested, as apparent coup unfoldsWhile well-worn, these justifications still resonate with many Africans today for the simple reason they continue to accurately depict the reality of their countries. Furthermore, in many countries, people feel these problems are worsening. The research network Afrobarometer conducted surveys  across 19 African countries which showed 6 in 10 respondents saying corruption is increasing in their country (the figure was 63% in Guinea) while 2 in 3 say their governments are doing a poor job fighting it. Furthermore, 72% believe ordinary citizens ""risk retaliation or other negative consequences"" if they report corruption to authorities, a sign Africans believe their public institutions are not just partakers in, but active defenders of, corrupt systems. When it comes to poverty, an already tragic situation has been worsened by the battering Africa's fragile economies took from the coronavirus pandemic.  One in three people are now unemployed in Nigeria, West Africa's largest economy. The same goes for South Africa, the most industrialized African nation. It is now estimated the number of extremely poor people in sub-Saharan Africa has crossed the 500 million mark, half the population. This in the youngest continent in the world with a median age of 20 and a faster-growing population than anywhere else, further intensifying an already fierce competition for resources.  These conditions create fertile conditions for coups and for increasingly desperate young Africans who have lost patience with their corrupt leaders to welcome coupists promising radical change, as was witnessed on the streets of Guinea following the takeover, with some elated Guineans even kissing the soldiers.  But as with the coups of the 1970s these scenes of joy will likely be shortlived, says Joseph Sany, Vice President of the Africa Center at the United States Institute of Peace. ""The initial reaction of what you see on the streets will be of joy, but very soon, people will be demanding action...  and I'm not sure the military will be able to deliver on the expectations, basic service delivery, more freedoms,"" he says.Threat to democratic gains  What is clear is that these coups pose a serious threat to the democratic gains African countries have made in recent decades. Worryingly, research shows that many Africans are increasingly ceasing to believe elections can deliver the leaders they want.  Surveys conducted across 19 African countries in 2019/20 showed just 4 in 10 respondents (42%) now believe elections work well to ensure ""MPs reflect voters' views"" and to ""enable voters remove non-performing leaders.""  In other words, less than half believe elections guarantee representativeness and accountability, key ingredients of functional democracies. Across 11 countries polled regularly since 2008, the belief elections enable voters remove non-performing leaders has dropped by 11% points among citizens, according to the survey. It is not that Africans no longer want to choose their leaders via elections, it is simply that many now believe their political systems are gamed.  Leaders like the deposed Conde are part of the problem. The only reason he was still in power until the coup was because he engineered constitutional changes in 2020 to enable himself serve a third-term as president, a common practise by several leaders on the continent, from Uganda's Yoweri Museveni to Alassane Ouattara in Côte d'Ivoire.  Mali's President resigns after he was arrested in a military coupThe African Union is rightly condemning Guinea's coup, but its response to such constitutional abuses has been muted. These double standards and perceived elite conspiracies create the perfect environment for young swashbuckling officers like the 41-year-old Doumbouya to step in and promise to save the day. ""If the people are crushed by their elites, it is up to the army to give the people their freedom,"" said Guinea's new leader, quoting the former Ghanaian president Jerry Rawlings who himself led two coupsIt is perhaps no coincidence Doumbouya quoted the feisty Rawlings, who was very effective at expressing the anger Ghanaians felt towards their political elites when he led military juntas in the 1980s. Desperate citizens living in political systems they often rightly believe are fixed can easily be seduced by anti-elite, anti-corruption rhetoric coupled with the promise of the new. We should, unfortunately, prepare ourselves for the eventuality of more coups in Africa in the coming years. They are not to be expected in richer countries with strong institutions such as South Africa, Ghana or Botswana but in the poorer more fragile states. As are Mali, Niger, Chad and now Guinea where coups and coup attempts have recently occurred. Fifteen of the twenty countries topping the 2021 Fragile States Index are in Africa, including countries like Cameroon, Central African Republic, Somalia and South Sudan as well as larger nations like Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia (which has been experiencing violent internal conflict for close to a year now) and Nigeria, Africa's most populous country.Men are marched out of prison camps. Then corpses float down the riverThis increasing probability of coups will make Africa in general less predictable and stable, a negative for investors that could end up worsening the economic situation. Can this undesirable trend be reversed? Yes, but while the international condemnations of coups in Guinea and elsewhere are crucial as deterrents to other would-be power grabbers, the only actors who truly have the power to reverse this worrying trend are African leaders themselves. They are the ones in charge on the ground and it is their response to these recent events that will be the deciding factor. They need to reignite the belief democracy can deliver for Africans. But if the problems still being cited to justify coups continue to worsen in today's African democracies, then the temptation to try something else will continue to be dangerously seductive, both for coupists and citizens alike."

","africa, Solhan, Burkina Faso: How children were used in a 48-hour deadly rampage for gold - CNN",How children were used in a 48-hour deadly rampage for gold,"(CNN)The men were shot as they slept outside, having spent their days underground, choking in the Sahel dust, digging and panning for gold. They were killed by children -- some apparently as young as 12 -- and men who had arrived on dozens of motorbikes and were egged on in their murderous spree by women who knew the village well, according to witnesses. The local militia had left. The army came to the rescue for a matter of hours in the morning but then left before dusk, letting the attackers return the following night to burn the village down and most likely steal what gold it had. In the end, somewhere between 170 and 200 people died, according to estimates by a local police source and other officials, and it still remains unclear who the killers were. The massacre in Solhan, northern Burkina Faso, took place over two nights of extraordinary brutality in June 2021. The killings soon faded from international headlines, absorbed into the rhythms of persistent violence in the Sahel region, an arid stretch of land sandwiched by the Sahara Desert and the African savannah, and wracked by the climate emergency. In the lawless and remote communities of the Sahel, jihadists increasingly hold sway. Yet one likely culprit in this incident, al Qaeda's local affiliate JNIM, condemned the attack's brutality. And the other main suspect, ISIS, chose to blame it on al Qaeda, according to an ISIS-affiliated newspaper. Read MoreDozens of interviews by CNN with survivors, local witnesses and Burkina Faso officials paint the most complete and disturbing narrative yet of a rampage perpetrated over 48 hours, partially by children, that the US-backed and trained Burkina Faso military was powerless to stop. Yet few officials or witnesses agree on a coherent and consistent motive for the attack. Were the child attackers sent for Solhan's gold, as currency for their Islamist masters? Was it a punishment killing ordered by jihadists against villagers loyal to the government? The story of Solhan is a notable mark in the patina of brutality spreading across the Sahel. The intervention -- and now ongoing drawdown -- of the French military, the arrival of European Union forces, and the Pentagon's sustained support mean billions have been spent in attempts to bolster the local security forces. Yet violence has spiraled instead, particularly in Burkina Faso over recent years. The crisis in some of sub-Saharan Africa's poorest states presents an imminent threat to Europe's security, and by extension the United States, analysts say, in providing a secure and spacious breeding ground for terror networks. US officials have described the ""wildfire of terrorism"" in the Sahel, with al Qaeda and ISIS ""on the march"" in West Africa, aiming to ""carve out a new caliphate.""Illicit gold has emerged as a key source of funding for jihadist groups, who have been seizing so-called ""informal mines"" -- small-scale mining sites which rely largely on physical labor and basic technology to extract precious metals and minerals -- in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger since 2016, according to a Crisis Group report from 2019. In this file photo taken in February 2020, miners work at a gold mine in Bouda, Burkina Faso. A growing number of small-scale gold miners are out of work in Burkina Faso as jihadists try to seize control of the country's most lucrative industry.Bachir Ismael Ouédraogo, Burkina Faso's minister of energy and mines, told CNN the country lost 20 tons of gold through informal mining and exports every year, worth roughly $1 billion on the open market. Ouédraogo describes it as a ""war economy,"" a system that uses well-coordinated routes across the African continent. ""The gold you end up buying is financing terrorism, and affecting our families here,"" he added.The first night: MassacreTrapped in the arid plains around 400 kilometers (250 miles) northeast of the capital Ouagadougou, Solhan's gold is the village's only asset, and its curse. Satellite images of the village show the damage that informal mining has done to the terracotta soil -- the charred grey tailings and spoil from the intense activity of men who spend so many hours digging underground that they must sleep outdoors to recover. A satelite view of the site of the attack on Solhan in Burkina Faso.A local government-backed militia called the VDP (a French acronym meaning Volunteers for the Defense of the Country) provides some security. Yet on the night of June 4, Solhan was left mostly defenseless.More than 100 jihadists, on dozens of tricycles and motorbikes, had been spotted 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Solhan that afternoon, according to Boureima Ly, the emir of the local region of Yagha. The army was warned of a possible attack, but it was unclear if it would target Solhan or nearby Sebba -- according to Aly Bokoum, an activist with the Sahel Regional Youth Council in Burkina Faso -- so the local unit chose to stay in Sebba, where it is based. The VDP in Solhan also contacted the army about the threat but were told to leave the village, according to Bokoum. There were women who came and instructed the children on who to kill.A police sourceCNN has made multiple attempts to contact Burkina Faso's army for comment.Gold appeared to set the attackers' priorities. Mines at Mousiga, a tiny settlement to Solhan's east, were hit first, according to a mining official and a miner who were present. Many of the survivors, witnesses and officials requested anonymity for their safety.""Their faces were hidden with scarves,"" the miner said of the assailants. ""There were many of them on bikes and they started shooting. I started running for my life -- for 30 kilometers, all night, to safety."" This miner said he did not see children among this group and two other officials denied the involvement of children at the Mousiga mines. The distant gunfire from Mousiga was misinterpreted by the Solhan miners, who ""thought it was the army coming"" on a routine patrol and so ""stayed next to their wells,"" said the mining official. The attackers then hit a VDP base on the road into the village, before moving on to their main target.On entering Solhan, the convoy of children, women and likely some men split. One group turned left towards the mines. Another drove calmly into the center of the village. A local shop in Solhan was completely destroyed in the attack. The first shots in Solhan, heard by witnesses at 2:08 a.m., were at the mines, the police source said. ""The gold-diggers were first ... ambushed ... killed at random,"" he said, while describing the typical night-time scene. ""Most of the [miners] sleep outside, on site. They can't sleep indoors, and they don't go home either. Usually only a few of them get into the well late at night, and most come out because of the heat.""One miner said some victims were shot dead as they slept outside and others were slaughtered as they worked, trapped underground. ""All [the attackers] found outside were people sleeping,"" he said. ""That's what made it possible for them to massacre them like that."" Another miner said: ""People started coming out of the pits and running ... running for our lives."" He added that others hid inside the 30-foot-deep wells.We saw the light from the bullets all over the place. It was only God who saved us, otherwise they were going to exterminate us all.A survivor of the attackThe mining official described how a large gun was positioned beneath a nearby tree for use in the attack. ""Many ran away, but when you run, you're going to be seen and they shoot,"" he said, adding that some miners survived by hiding in the pits until 8 a.m. ""The first person who went down to the site [the following day] called me, and said the bodies were lying like fish,"" the official said. Several witnesses and officials told CNN that the attackers had in-depth knowledge of Solhan's layout. ""These are people who take the time to study their target,"" confirmed the police source, who said witnesses mentioned distinctly hearing women's voices among the attackers. ""They indicated to 'go to into this guy's house, do this and that,' and told children to 'go here and there,' that they couldn't let one person leave,"" the source said.Local activist Abdou Hoeffi, from the human rights group Burkina Faso Movement for Human and People's Rights (MBDHP), said the women played a cheerleading role with the child assailants, with shouts of: ""You are a good shooter! You go!""One witness, who said his parents were killed in the attack, told CNN in Solhan: ""They came with women and little children holding guns. Francois, a shopkeeper, he was taken away, my friend. If it was a man, they killed him -- a boy, they kidnapped him. A little one like that,"" he said, gesturing the embrace of an infant in his arms, ""who was breastfeeding [was taken away]. His mother lost her mind.""The road leading into Solhan. The attackers arrived on motorbikes, according to eyewitnesses.One Solhan woman, her bright blue dress glistening as she sifted grains through a sieve, described surviving the night: ""They destroyed everything ... I fled into my house with my child on my back ... I couldn't sleep all night. We saw the light from the bullets all over the place ... It was only God who saved us, otherwise they were going to exterminate us all.""Another witness said he and his wife were in bed with their 5-day-old baby when they heard the gunfire. ""Three terrorists passed by my house, in front of me, talking. They did not stop. I could see the bullets raining down everywhere in the night."" The witness, a former security guard for the local cellphone antenna, said the attackers disabled the phone mast that night and removed its battery, cutting the village off from the outside world and a chance of help.The attackers left at dawn, and the same witness said that the villagers started to venture outside again by 5 a.m. ""I couldn't count the number of corpses that were on the side of the road,"" he recalled. ""Everywhere you go, there are bodies lying around.""The mine was also an apocalyptic scene. ""We found that everyone died at the well. I made up to eight trips with a motorcycle cab to carry corpses,"" said another survivor.""  The mining official added that ""everyone was loaded on and off the motorbikes like bags of grain.""The area around the mine at Solhan was left damaged.Then the army finally arrived. One miner told CNN the attackers depended on the military's slow reaction when launching their assault. ""This is Burkina Faso. There is no fast response,"" the miner said. ""If they knew that in 30 or 40 minutes the army would come, they wouldn't [attack]. But they took all their time."" When the military did arrive, there was little to do but bury the dead, he said. ""They dug a big hole. There was no other solution."" The ex-phone antenna guard said the security forces asked villagers ""to go back home and lock the door, and to not hide any terrorists.""Six bodies were found at this location after the attack on Solhan in June 2021.Two officials said the militants' convoy did not really leave at first light but instead relocated to a hideout in the brush, and waited. The mining official specified a remote border area where he believed they had hidden. The police source said it was not clear if they met leaders there for further instructions, or just waited for the cover of night.Some of the villagers who remained in Solhan tried to flee, said the police source. ""They didn't know if it was over or not,"" he said. The hospital in the nearest city, Dori, was ""overwhelmed,"" he said. But it was unclear if the attackers were finished with Solhan. At dusk, the answer came.The second night: Destruction""I heard the sound of their motorcycles and said, 'Ah, they are [here] again,'"" one witness said. ""I went back to my yard, turned off the lights in my house, took my mat, took my blanket."" He said he left for another village -- traveling on foot with a group of Solhan's children, elderly residents and pregnant women. But the convoy's focus was different this time: They wanted to eradicate or loot all that remained. ""They started to burn. They entered the houses,"" said one survivor. ""At the stores, they took clothes, drinks, money, put them in their vehicles.""""They came back, they found four motorcycles at our place,"" another survivor said. ""They burned everything. They burned all our houses, until even the sheet metal was gone. They took rice, sugar, oil and boxes of other things.""Showing a cameraman around what remained of his home, the survivor gestured to the devastation -- the walls black with soot, apart from a patch where the TV was fixed before it too was looted. ""The grenade went through the wall and went to the other side,"" he said, pointing at a missing patch of plaster. ""The whole roof is gone.""The mining official said 80 sheep were also slaughtered in the violence. Young men who survived the onslaught sought medication for the psychological trauma in nearby Dori, he added. ""They were given pills or injections, because they say they couldn't close their eyes, because they could still see the dead bodies.""Video filmed in July shows the charred village clinic -- the hospital beds and consultation room beyond use. Shops and homes were incinerated, and rows of buildings left collapsed or with only their metal gates remaining. Motorcycles were torched. Even the mining machinery used to break rocks was half-smashed, yet in the video some of it still hummed around the mines that remained functioning.   Shell casings still lay on the ground. The scale of destruction -- fueled, it seemed, by something more nihilistic than just looting -- surprised some officials. Shell casings were found at the site of the attack in Solhan.Since June, officials, experts and survivors have been seeking to understand more about the massacre. The government, facing protests in Dori over its inaction and security failings, blamed jihadists. Government spokesperson Ousseni Tamboura told Radio France Internationale that two suspects had been detained before the attack and the arrests had led officials to link it to a little-known group called Mujahed al Qaeda, which is connected to the al Qaeda affiliate JNIM. Tamboura said gold was also a motivating factor. In the immediate aftermath, the government fired some security personnel and declared three days of national mourning.Tamboura told CNN in November the government believes al Qaeda affiliate JNIM was behind the massacre. He put the death toll at 132, which includes attackers killed in the incident, and fatalities from a neighboring attack. Tamboura declined to comment on the army's absence in Solhan that night, and said that the Burkina Faso military followed all protocols set between them and the US as a condition for aid. The spokesman added that the jihadi groups were fueled by hunger to control resources, not by ideology.A French military intelligence official, who didn't want to be named discussing sensitive information, agreed that jihadists were likely responsible, saying the massacre was likely committed by a group ""in the process of being formed,"" linked to JNIM. The official said attacks against the general population, as indiscriminate as those on Solhan, were more the hallmark of ISIS, however.Display of violenceBeds inside the local health clinic were burnt. The display of violence has once again highlighted the rapid deterioration of social structures and security in the Sahel region. A US intelligence official said: ""There is absolutely a continued need for Western involvement and engagement to address the expansion of the al Qaeda- and ISIS-based groups in the area and not give them complete freedom of movement -- as well as to build [the] capability [and] capacity of African partners.""The US official added that the crisis seemed to be fueled by local partnerships between jihadists and not an influx of ISIS fighters from the collapse of the former ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria. They said that they have not noticed a broad trend of ISIS fighters moving from the Middle East to the Sahel area, with the exception of one or two persons of interest. The official said the main concern was how ISIS affiliates across Africa were able to share tactics and build each other's capabilities. ""Whether it's physical facilitation capabilities from a group like ISIS Somalia with more skilled fighters [or] better media coordination from other groups, and being able to rapidly disseminate those capabilities more widely ... it is hugely concerning,"" they explained. ""You could take a group that is probably not very effective and make them very effective quickly, if they're able to leverage some of that skill set.""In Burkina Faso and its Sahel neighbors Mali and Niger, armed Islamist groups have killed more than 800 civilians in attacks during 2021 alone, according to Human Rights Watch.  Three days of mourning was declared in Burkina Faso after an August attack in the village of Gorgadji, about 50 kilometers west of Dori, where militants killed 80 people, reported Agence France-Presse. Fourteen soldiers were reportedly ambushed and killed in October near Yirgou, also in the north, the site of a similar attack that killed 15 police in June, according to Reuters. Gunmen killed dozens of people in another massacre in Yirgou in 2019, according to Amnesty International.People protest on June 22, 2019 in front of the Ouagadougou courthouse to demand ""truth and justice"" for the victims of a terrorist attack in Yirgou that left 49 dead.This rise in violence has occurred despite the US's enduring, low-profile military mission in Burkina Faso, which pumped in tens of millions of dollars in aid during 2018-19.Dozens of advisers are reported to mentor elements of the country's military, while a US embassy factsheet said the US has trained and equipped 3,000 soldiers and gendarmes. Yet significant swathes of Burkina Faso's volatile north remain outside of the government's control. Long-running accusations of abuses by the military have also complicated its relationship with its key military backers, specifically France and the US.Human rights organizations also face difficulties in Burkina Faso. The government suspended the operations of the Norwegian Refugee Council in September after the humanitarian group noted the country's speed at registering displaced people.  For the police source, however, the massacre at Solhan was particularly methodical and unparalleled in its brutality. ""These are people who take the time to study their target,"" he said. ""It is painful to see a woman instructing a child to kill such and such. Painful.""And for the survivors, the initial absence of the army, as well as its departure as night fell, are indications of the dark place they live in. ""If the [army] are not with the people, how is that possible?,"" one survivor said. ""As soon as the army left, [the attackers] came again. This is a strange country. It's a strange country."""

After an Egyptian foul in the penalty box, Liverpool star Sadio Mané's penalty kick was saved in spectacular fashion by goalkeeper Mohamed Abou Gabal, also known as Gabaski, in the seventh minute. But after 30 scoreless minutes of extra time, which featured a pair of stellar saves from Gabaski and Senegalese keeper Edouard Mendy, the game went to penalty kicks.Another clutch save from Mendy set Mané up with a chance at redemption.

The fact that said sounds could be emanating from one of the best basketball players on the planet merely adds to the intrigue.When he's not playing Most Valuable Player-caliber ball for the Philadelphia 76ers -- and his definition of ""a bad night"" was a near triple-double of 26 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists in a 105-87 rout of the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday -- five-time NBA All-Star Joel Embiid is rooting for his nation of Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), which his homeland happens to be hosting. Saturday's quarterfinal pits the Indomitable Lions against The Gambia in a match Embiid's team is expected to win. Victory would mean Cameroon is two games away from lifting a sixth AFCON title, with the most recent coming in 2017, the center's rookie year for the 76ers.Embiid was named Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month just three days before Cameroon defeated Egypt 2-1 in the 2017 final; a match-up which, if all things fall into place, could happen again on Sunday, February 6th.Read More""The excitement level has always been huge,"" Embiid tells CNN Sport's Amanda Davies about his love of the Cameroon national team dating back to childhood. ""The crazy thing is that when Cameroon would always play, anytime they would score, everybody would just scream. You could hear the whole country just scream.""Joel Embiid is playing at an MVP level this season.The love of the LionsWhile his remarkable journey brought Embiid to America at the age of 16 -- first via high school and college in Florida and Kansas, and subsequently selected 3rd overall in the 2014 NBA Draft by Philadelphia -- he was born a few years after Cameroon's fairytale run to the quarterfinals of the 1990 World Cup in Italy.The first African nation to advance to the last eight, a mere seven minutes away from reaching the final four, Cameroon eventually succumbed to England in extra-time. Along the way, the Indomitable Lions wowed the world, starting with the upset of reigning champion Argentina in the opening match. ""Obviously, Roger Milla kind of put us on the map,"" recalls Embiid about the then 38-year-old striker Milla scoring four times at Italia '90, gaining further fame for his trademark goal celebration of dancing by the corner flag.""Going back through history and watching the games, and learning through the history before I was born, and obviously the celebration was a huge part of that history ... we have a lot of history coming from Cameroon, and any time I get the chance to kind of be part of it, I always enjoy.""READ: Iranian women allowed to watch landmark moment as Iran qualifies for World CupEmbiid has watched all of Cameroon's matches at AFCON.Embiid believes that the class of 2022 can reign supreme at Africa's showpiece tournament. ""We're playing at home so any time you've got the support from your home fans that usually adds a lot to your motivation to go on and win every single game,"" he observes.""Playing at home is a huge advantage for us, and I think we've got a chance to win it all ... I'm excited to keep watching and keep supporting.""Cameroon's success at AFCON notwithstanding, the fortunes of a football team pale in comparison to the deaths which occurred at the Olembe Stadium in Yaoundé last Monday due to a stadium crush. At least eight people were killed and 38 injured during the Round of 16 game between Cameroon and Comoros.A somber Embiid says: ""I'm a man of God, so I pray for those families to find peace and also for their loved ones to find peace and be at peace. It is tragic that it happened and I'm extremely sorry for it."" Given the horrific events, what would it mean to Embiid and Cameroon if the team does go on to lift the trophy?""As a country, we've been through a lot,"" he reveals. ""We haven't had any competition [held] over there for a long time, so to be able to finally get it and to be able to win, I think is going to be huge for us.""Embiid tells CNN he's set his sights on winning the MVP award this season.AFCON getting more creditIn the build up to AFCON 2022, there was discussion in some quarters that stars such as Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (Egypt) and Sadio Mané (Senegal), Manchester City's Riyad Mahrez (Algeria), Paris Saint-Germain's Achraf Hakimi (Morocco) and Kalidou Koulibaly (Senegal) temporarily leaving their club sides behind was such a bitter pill for their club sides and supporters to swallow, it overshadowed the prestige which comes from representing one's country, to say nothing of elevating the tournament to the levels attained across other continents. Embiid follows European football closely, so does he concur that AFCON fails to get the credit it deserves on the global stage?Substitute keeper Abo Gabal the shootout hero as Egypt advance""It's messed up,"" Embiid quickly concludes. ""When it always comes to Africa, I feel like there's always kind of double standards. I never hear any complaints when it comes to the European Cup or any other cups.""[AFCON]'s a little different because obviously it's going on during the season over there, and some of the best players, when you talk about someone like Mo Salah or Sadio [Mané] they're supposed to be playing for their clubs. But I also appreciate them wanting to just go back and represent their country, which is good.""I think we're still earning our respect ... when you look at the success that Africa has in general, we have a lot of talent. Not just in football but in basketball or other sports too. Over time, we're going to overcome that but it's getting there slowly.""As for the big man himself, when asked what would mean more to him -- Cameroon triumphing at AFCON or Embiid winning MVP -- he smiles. ""That's tough! I want both -- both would be great!""It would have been a better question if you were to ask me between Cameroon winning or me winning a championship!"" Asked then which he would prefer, Embiid said, ""Both would be great, like I said, I'm a competitor -- I want to win.""Embiid will be tuning in to watch Cameroon's quarterfinal against The Gambia.After detailing the hard work Cameroon made of their previous opponents Comoros, as the continental minnows played much of the match with 10 men and the entire game with an outfield player in goal, Embiid gives a message to the team of his heart ahead of the challenges which await.""Go out there and keep doing whatever they've been doing. At the end, they've been doing great. They have our full support to continue to do so and I really hope that they're able to keep that cup in our home territory, so I'm gonna keep supporting them. Like I said, I'm going to be watching the rest of the games.""Will we see another iconic celebration like Embiid's Twitter video of Max Verstappen's maiden Formula One title if the Indomitable Lions pull off their sixth AFCON crown? ""I hope the excitement of when we get to the final is the same thing [as the F1 finale]. We might get one!"""

It also brought attention to a larger issue at hand: A lack of diversity in medical illustrations.(While most fetuses are red in color -- newborns come out dark pink or red and only gradually develop the skin tone they will have for life -- the medical illustration is intended to represent patients who aren't used to seeing their skin tones in such images.)Ibe said in an interview with HuffPost UK that he didn't expect to receive such an overwhelming response -- his fetus illustration was one of many such images he's created as a medical illustrator, most of which depict Black skin tones. But it underscored the importance of a mission he's long been committed to.Read More""The whole purpose was to keep talking about what I'm passionate about -- equity in healthcare -- and also to show the beauty of Black people,"" he told the publication. ""We don't only need more representation like this -- we need more people willing to create representation like this.""CNN reached out to Ibe for comment, but he did not expand on the topic further.Ni-Ka Ford, diversity committee chair for the Association of Medical Illustrators, said that the organization was grateful for Ibe's illustration.""Along with the importance of representation of Black and Brown bodies in medical illustration, his illustration also serves to combat another major flaw in the medical system, that being the staggering disproportionate maternal mortality rate of Black women in this country,"" she wrote in an email to CNN.What medical illustration isMedical illustrations have been used for thousands of years to record and communicate procedures, pathologies and other facets of medical knowledge, from the ancient Egyptians to Leonardo da Vinci. Science and art are combined to translate complex information into visuals that can communicate concepts to students, practitioners and the public. These images are used not just in textbooks and scientific journals, but also films, presentations and other mediums.There are fewer than 2,000 trained medical illustrators in the world, according to the Association of Medical Illustrators. With only a handful of accredited medical illustration programs in North America, which tend to be expensive and admit few students, the field has historically been dominated by people who are White and male -- which, in turn, means the bodies depicted have usually been so, too.Black or 'Other'? Doctors may be relying on race to make decisions about your health""Historically [medical illustrations] have always featured white able bodied male figures and still do in the present day,"" Ford said. ""Bias towards one body type in medical illustration marginalizes everyone else.""Studies have backed up this lack of diversity. Researchers at the University of Wollogong in Australia found in a 2014 study that out of more than 6,000 images with an identifiable sex across 17 anatomy textbooks published between 2008 and 2013, just 36% of the depicted bodies were female. A vast majority were White. About 3% of the images analyzed showed disabled bodies, while just 2% featured elderly people.Why diversity in the field mattersDiversity in the field of medical illustrations (or lack thereof) matters because these images can have implications for medical trainees, practitioners and patients. ""Without equitable representation and the perpetual use of only white able bodied patients depicted in medical textbooks, medical professionals are limited in their ability to accurately diagnose and treat people who don't fit that mold,"" Ford said. ""Medical professionals can then tend to rely on racial stereotypes and generalizations because of this knowledge gap on how symptoms present differently on darker skin tones, leading to poorer care.""A study by the same University of Wollogong researchers published in 2018 found that gender-biased images from anatomy textbooks increased medical students' scores on implicit bias tests. Another study published in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery -- Global Open in 2019 found that White patients were overrepresented in the images of plastic surgery journals, which the authors suggested could potentially influence the care non-White patients received. Black adults report bias in health care at higher rates than White and Latino people, study finds""For decades, peer-reviewed academic publications have used photographs and images that inadequately portray the diversity in demographics of patients affected by particular diseases,"" the researchers wrote. ""This is particularly striking in the lack of diversity in medical illustration. These inequities in medical reporting can have lasting downstream effects on the accessibility and provision of healthcare.""Ford said that those who aren't often depicted in medical illustrations ""can feel left out and unacknowledged in a healthcare setting, leading to feelings of distrust and isolation when receiving care."" She also said that medical professionals might feel less empathy for groups who aren't represented -- people who are Black, brown, women, transgender or nonbinary -- which can lessen the quality of care they receive. Inequities in health care have been well-documented, with studies showing that Black patients are more likely to experience bias and be misdiagnosed for certain conditions. Research has also shown that a substantial share of White medical students and residents hold false notions about biological differences between Black and White people, which can lead to racial bias in the ways their pain is perceived and treated.Despite the persistent need for medical illustrations to depict the full scope of human diversity, the field is beginning to see changes, medical illustrator Hillary Wilson told CNN.Wilson, whose illustrations depict Black people in infographics about eczema, sun damage, alopecia and other conditions, said both patients and practitioners could benefit from seeing diversity represented in medical illustrations. And through her work, she's attempting to humanize people of color and other marginalized groups by doing just that. ""The reality is that there are so many different types of people that exist,"" she said. ""To me, a resource isn't complete if I didn't at least consider that and try my best to account for the fact that there are so many different types of people.""While Ibe's image of the Black fetus seemed to mark a departure from the norm, Wilson said she hopes that in the future, seeing Black skin tones in medical illustrations will become routine.""Eventually, I hope it can just become one of the things that's expected,"" she added."

""This is food meant for human consumption that we typically lose along the supply chain, either during harvesting, transportation, or distribution,"" says Ikegwuonu. ""The mission really is to reduce food spoilage due to lack of cold food storage at key points along the food supply chain."" Read MoreTackling a food waste crisisNigeria is ranked 100 out of 113 countries on the Global Food Security Index. Over 88 million people in the country face food insecurity and 12% are undernourished. The problem isn't a lack of food, though: it's an excess of waste. An alarming 40% of the food Nigeria produces every year is lost before it even reaches consumers. That's equal to 31% of its total land use, according to the World Bank, and accounts for 5% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions. How floating islands can make urban waterways green and clean Ikegwuonu's ColdHubs are 10-foot-square cold storage units which keep produce fresh for up to 21 days. Conventional cold storage units of this size would be powered by diesel generators and require 20 to 30 liters of diesel every day, says Ikegwuonu -- but by using solar panels instead, he says that across all its units, the company prevents over 1 million kilograms of CO2 entering the atmosphere each year, while powering the units 24/7. According to the UN, food waste accounts for up to 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, so finding solutions to reduce waste could be vital in the fight against climate change. Storing a crate of produce in the ColdHub costs around 25 cents per day, and has helped farmers and retailers double their monthly earnings, says Ikegwuonu: ""This has been achieved by selling produce that was previously thrown away, sold off at the right price."" ColdHubs are now available at farms and markets in 22 Nigerian states.Scaling upLooking to the future, Ikegwuonu says ColdHubs is also developing technology to freeze produce, for fishing communities in the Niger Delta. ""Most of the coastal communities don't have access to energy at all,"" he says, adding that these freezer storage units would also have the capacity to produce ice blocks. Ikegwuonu also wants to extend his social impact by creating gender parity and jobs in a country where around 35% of all employment is in agriculture, and 90% of rural livelihoods depend on it.""We have been able to create about 66 new jobs for women,"" he says.

First of all, we have to give more Black people opportunity in our own institutions and organizations. We have to continue to figure out a way to be decision-makers, be in these boardrooms. It's not only hire an intern or hire a diversity and inclusion officer -- we have to be in positions where decisions are being made in the best way. For me personally, there are a couple of projects that we are working on that I cannot speak too much about now that I am 100% excited about.

While Amapiano dance challenges are currently sweeping TikTok, the streets of South Africa have been thrumming with its sound for years.Seeping out of car windows and overflowing from clubs, Amapiano is more than a genre of music -- it is influencing style and dance and making an impact on South Africa's music industry. Believed to have started in 2012, this underground trend exploded in popularity during the Covid-19 pandemic, and has been on the rise ever since.""We noticed a lot of our youths at the end of 2019 starting to use Amapiano music to create their food videos, their dance videos, their fashion videos, memes.

In 2021, videos using the hashtag #Amapiano flexed their muscles on the popular app with more than 1.6 billion global views -- while the ""Amapiano Grooves"" playlist on Spotify had more than 50 million streams worldwide.Read MoreUncertain originsWhile its popularity is unquestioned, the birth of Amapiano -- which means ""the pianos"" in South Africa's Zulu language -- is often the subject of debate. The genre's roots are disputed says AshMopedi, host of the Amapiano-dedicated YouTube channel Groove Cartel. ""Perhaps it comes from the Gauteng region [northeastern province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria], where its origins can be traced, but as to who is that one person that created Amapiano, it's a difficult thing,"" he says.

Music producer,  record label owner, and Kwaito pioneer Oscar Sibonginkosi Mdlongwa, known as Oskido, says Kwaito emerged following a period of political change, that saw the release of Nelson Mandela and the decline of apartheid.""The younger generation at that time, we started creating our own music, which we called Kwaito.

A more inclusive soundAlthough Amapiano started out as a genre dominated by male artists, more women are now stepping onto the scene -- from DJ'ing and dancing to singing and even fashion design. Part of the draw is what dancer Bontle Modiselle describes as an ""inviting"" style. According to dancer Bontle Modiselle, dance moves like ""legwork,"" the ""pouncing cat,"" and the ""Zekethe"" that are associated with Amapiano are simple and easy. ""When I think about Amapiano, I think about it being the perfect representation of what the Black South African youth today looks like and the fashion, what they feel like, what they sound like in their sounds, how they move in their dance moves,"" she says.Modiselle has amassed large followings on TikTok and Instagram, where she showcases Amapiano dances that pay homage to the past.'Dance is a purpose': After losing his leg, South Africa's Musa Motha is inspiring with every move""The visual representation of Amapiano is such that it breeds from a ground of familiarity,"" she says. ""You'll see a lot of Kwaito-esque movements that are reimagined in the look of Amapiano today.""At the same time, that inviting style makes it accessible. ""It just allows a culture where anyone, from anywhere, of any age can get together and do the same moves and feel like they're a part of the same story,"" she adds.Yet success for women in Amapiano hasn't come easily.

In 2013, he decided to create his own game while studying at the University of Calabar in southern Nigeria.""There was a nationwide strike at government-owned universities in the country at the time, so nobody was going to class,"" Ogbuagu, now 29, says. With nothing to do, ""eventually, we started playing tabletop games."" At the time, he was not sure how to create games, so he used cardboard, stones, and dice from an old Ludo game to make a dice rolling and card drafting game for him and his friends.Read MoreMany of Ogbuagu's friends in school enjoyed playing the game, inspiring him to turn his passion into a profession. Created in 2017, ""Homia"" is a memory and recognition game card game where players race to build their Nigerian home to win. Creating made-in-Nigeria gamesIn 2016, a few years after making his first game, Ogbuagu founded a game production publishing company called NIBCARD, which focuses on tabletop games such as board and card games.""I eventually learned to make games on YouTube,"" he says. ""I learned how to make boards. I learned about direct imaging printers. I also found stores where I could get material to make the games I wanted.""That same year, he started an annual convention in Abuja, Nigeria's capital city, called the Africa Boardgame Convention, or ""AbCon"" -- a gathering of tabletop game lovers from across the country, which Ogbuagu says is the first of its kind in West Africa. ""Wan wan touch"" is a football-based board game. It was created in 2018. ""Many Nigerians hold stereotypes about board games. They say, 'oh, it is a woman's game.' The convention exists to cancel those types of stereotypes,"" Ogbuagu explains. Roughly 500 people attend the convention every year, he adds. But his big break came in 2017 when charity organization Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) hired NIBCARD to create 2,300 copies of a game called ""Luku Luku"" for an education project it was running in the country.Read more: African artists are banking on a record-breaking art marketOgbuagu had been working with VSO as a volunteer when the group found out he was into games. ""I met British colleagues who liked to play card games. I became inspired by their games and wanted to make something like that in Nigeria,"" he says. Since making Luku Luku for VSO, Ogbuagu says NIBCARD has created at least two dozen tabletop games for sale across the country and received grants from organizations including the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM).""With the (IOM) grant, we were supposed to, in an artistic way, create an activity that will create awareness on migration,"" Ogbuagu says. To achieve this, he created a tile-placement game called ""My World Trip.""""Gbosi,"" debuting in 2018, is a tile placement war game.""The game has maps of different countries and the names and continent of the countries,"" he explains. ""As players are jumping from country to country trying to win the game, they are forced to learn new countries that they probably have never heard of.""Nigeria's tabletop gaming industry According to a report in Dicebreaker, a publication focused on tabletop games, the 2020 Covid-19 lockdown period renewed interest in games and increased the sales of board games in places like the US and UK. In the same year, tabletop games successfully raised $236.6 million on Kickstarter, accounting for nearly a third of all the money made on the crowd-sourcing platform in 2020.This 9-year-old has built more than 30 mobile gamesBut in Nigeria, there is hardly any data about the tabletop game industry. While games like chess, Ludo, and Scrabble are popular, the local sector is still largely untapped.Ogbuagu says one of the reasons the industry is struggling is because there aren't a lot of board and card games designed and produced in the country.""Many Nigerians don't have access to information about where to get games made in the country. There is also no access to tabletop games cafes and other value chains surrounding these games,"" he explains.Read more: Disney announces 'first-of-its-kind' collaboration with African entertainment companyIt is difficult for the average Nigerian to find information about games, he adds: ""People will most likely know where to find Scrabble or chess than where to find their local, made-in-Nigeria games.""A home-grown movementIn 2019, as a way of increasing that awareness, Ogbuagu opened a cafe in Abuja.""The cafe is just a space filled with games. People can come there to play,"" he says, with 60 Nigerian-made board games and another 300 non-Nigerian games. ""Not all the games there are made by NIBCARD,"" he adds. ""We stock games from other people too.""""Hut Alive,"" created by Ogbuagu in 2017, is an elimination card game for up to six players.In the next couple of years, another goal is to get more people to appreciate and access locally made games, which starts with visibility.He says he is currently in talks with filmmakers from the country, encouraging them to swap games such as chess in their movies for Nigerian games like the ones NIBCARD produces.He's also trying to reach the next generation of tabletop gamers, with ""volunteers that take our games to different schools across the country,"" Ogbuagu says. ""They teach children to play these games so that as they are growing up, they know that we have our own Nigerian games."""

The image started a discussion about a lack of representation in these illustrations -- images that are mostly found in textbooks and scientific journals to show medical pathologies and procedures.JUST WATCHEDArtist behind viral image of Black fetus speaks outReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHArtist behind viral image of Black fetus speaks out 02:24Ibe, 25, who is creative director at the Association of Future African Neurosurgeons, has now been invited to have some of his illustrations published in the second edition of a handbook designed to show how a range of conditions appear on dark skin.""Mind the Gap: A clinical handbook of signs and symptoms in Black and Brown Skin,"" was first published in 2020. Co-author Malone Mukwende, a medical student in London, wrote over email that ""Chidiebere's work ... unearths some of the biases that exist in medicine in plain sight that we may not be aware of. Representation in healthcare is imperative to ensure that we do not allow implicit biases to cultivate in our heads.""Read MoreIbe, who earned a chemistry degree in Nigeria and is now studying medicine in Ukraine, only began his medical illustrations in 2020. He has already created images depicting anatomy and a range of conditions, such as the skin disorder vitiligo, cold sores, a chest infection and spinal injuries, all in Black people. Medical student and illustrator Chidiebere Ibe.Ibe says that a lack of illustrations of skin conditions in Black skin makes it hard for medical students to diagnose them. Mukwende hopes that together they can create ""the blueprint for the world"" in terms of what diverse medical textbooks should look like and that ""Mind the Gap"" will be known as ""the go-to textbook for representation of a variety of skin tones."" A ""big gap"" in representationDr. Jenna Lester, an assistant professor in the department of Dermatology at the University of California, San Francisco, describes Ibe's illustrations as ""incredible.""Lester is director of the university's Skin of Color program, which provides a space for Black, Asian, Latinx and indigenous people to understand conditions that affect them and become more comfortable seeking care. She says she realized that there was a ""big gap"" in representation in dermatology back when she was a student, and a lecturer told the class a certain condition would look different in dark skin, but not how the condition would appear. Lester says that she is ""grateful"" that now ""people are actually responding and recognizing it as a big problem and making changes to address it."" Chidiebere Ibe started creating medical illustrations  in 2020, and depicts a range of conditions and anatomy, all in Black people.""I think it's important to increase representation across the board because ... who knows what young mind this inspires when they see themselves represented in this way, who might be inspired to go into science or become a physician or nurse or something like that, by seeing themselves depicted in these illustrations?"" she adds.Studies have shown this lack of diversity. A 2014 study by researchers at the University of Wollongong in Australia examined gender bias in anatomy textbooks and found that of more than 6,000 images with an identifiable sex published between 2008 and 2013 in 17 textbooks, the vast majority were White and just over a third were female. About 3% showed disabled bodies and 2% featured elderly people.Covid-19 has exposed healthcare disparities In some Western countries, people of color have been disproportionately affected by the Covid pandemic. Research by the CDC found that racial and ethnic minority groups have had higher rates of hospitalization and emergency care for Covid-19 than White people in the US. Lester says that ""Covid-19 has highlighted a lot of issues of disparities, and that has led us to think about disparities and all the ways that they show up, including in dermatology.""The vast majority of images in anatomy textbooks are of White people. Ibe is working on a textbook on birth defects in children, which he says will be illustrated with Black skin images.Lester co-authored a research letter published in the British Journal of Dermatology in May 2020 which found that scientific articles describing the skin manifestations of Covid-19 ""almost exclusively show(ed) clinical images from patients with lighter skin,"" with no published photos of the manifestations in dark skin. It noted that this may make it more difficult for dermatologists and the public to identify the virus.This is compounded by the issue of some medical equipment not working as effectively on people with darker skin tones. Pulse oximeters, which measure a patient's oxygen level by using light and a sensor to detect the color of the blood, and which have been increasingly used during the pandemic, have been found to provide less accurate readings on darker skin. If they are not calibrated for darker skin tones, the pigmentation could affect how the light is absorbed.""It's not just about the skin conditions,"" says Ibe. ""It's just about giving everybody the value that they deserve. Black, White, Asian -- let's all have equal healthcare that we deserve.""A network of African medical illustratorsDespite making up an eighth of the world's population, Africa accounted for less than 1% of global research output between 2012 and 2016. Even in Nigeria, White skin images dominate the medical literature, says Ibe. His goal is to help remedy that by setting up a network of African medical illustrators.Ibe plans to become a pediatric neurosurgeon and is also working on a textbook on birth defects in children, which will be illustrated with Black skin images.""I want it to be a norm that whenever a person searches online for a particular skin condition, a particular health challenge, that the first pop-ups are Black illustrations or are illustrations of people of color,"" he says."

But it's coming under huge pressure from developed countries to abandon fossil fuels and shift to renewable energy in order to help save the climate.Nigeria is not the only country confronting this dilemma. At the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, developing economies across Africa, Asia and Latin America are facing increasing pressure to cut carbon emissions at the very moment they are industrializing, a process that powered the advance of the West and lifted billions of people out of poverty.At the same time, many poor countries that have so far contributed very little to global CO2 emissions are particularly vulnerable to rising temperatures and increased droughts, fires and floods linked to climate change, which threaten food security and exacerbate water scarcity. Nigeria's largest city Lagos, for example, may become uninhabitable by the end of this century if sea levels continue rising, according to scientific projections. It is already grappling with an eroding coastline that makes the city vulnerable to flooding. Read MoreYet the average person in Nigeria emits less than 0.7 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to the World Bank. That compares with the European Union's 6.4 metric tons per capita and North America's 15.3 metric tons.  ""The biggest justice issue is that the countries that are the least developed are also the most vulnerable and have the least ability to adapt to climate impacts,"" said Amal-Lee Amin, climate change director at CDC Group, Britain's development finance institution.If poor countries are asked to give up fossil fuel production, experts say their wealthy counterparts need to spend trillions of dollars to develop solutions that both spur economic development and protect the planet. If that doesn't happen, the global poor may be left behind in the energy transition.Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2060 on Tuesday, joining other large energy exporters including Saudi Arabia. But he also told COP26 attendees that Nigeria needs ""adequate and sustained technical and financial support"" to meet its goal.Lagos on May 13 2020, shortly after the government eased coronavirus lockdown measures.Untapped resourcesMillions of Nigerians don't have access to electricity. But the country's government and economy depend on energy.Nigeria is Africa's biggest oil producer, with fossil fuels accounting for 60% of government revenue and 90% of foreign exchange earnings. The Petroleum Industry Act, which Buhari signed into law in August, envisions an even greater role for oil and gas in Nigeria's economy.""The intent [of the Act] is to really transform the industry for us to be able to attract the required investment into oil and gas,"" explained Adewale Ajayi, a partner at KPMG in Lagos. That entails ramping up oil production to 4 million barrels per day, from 1.6 million barrels currently, and drawing on the country's roughly 200 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves to provide much needed electricity. ""We have enormous reserves of gas in Nigeria and we need to be able to tap into those resources to develop the Nigerian economy,"" Ajayi told CNN Business, adding that alongside power generation, gas will also be crucial to developing industries such as petrochemicals and fertilizers.The law also lays the groundwork for developing oil refining capacity, which would allow Nigeria to stop importing virtually all of its fuel at an enormous cost.Change can't come quickly enough in a country where some 90 million people, or more than 40% of the population, don't have access to electricity and more than 80 million live on less than $1 a day. ""Nigeria will soon, certainly before 2050, have a larger population than the United States, but it has less than 1% of America's electricity generation capacity,"" said Todd Moss, executive director of the Energy for Growth Hub, a nonprofit focused on energy for development based in Washington D.C. Nigeria's installed power generation capacity is about 13 gigawatts, but only about 4 or 5 gigawatts reaches end users due to breakdowns in transmission and distribution. By comparison, the United States has over 1,000 gigawatts of utliity-scale electricity generating capacity.""Nigeria just needs a lot more energy,"" added Moss. Can't afford to waitNigeria's energy ambitions are coming up against a global drive by banks, pension funds and development finance institutions to limit or altogether halt investments into fossil fuels in line with net-zero emissions goals.""They're prioritizing global emissions over Africa's development needs,"" said Moss. Across Sub-Saharan Africa, natural gas projects are ""increasingly imperiled by a lack of development finance,"" according to Nigeria's Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.""Efforts to restrict fossil fuel investments in Africa are even harder to stomach because many of the wealthy countries behind them — including Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States — include natural gas in their own multidecade plans to transition to clean energy,"" Osinbajo wrote recently in Foreign Affairs.The world plans to produce far more fossil fuel than it should to stay under dangerous climate limits, UN saysThe European Investment Bank will end financing for fossil fuel energy projects from the end of this year, with some exceptions for gas-fired power plants, while the World Bank, the biggest provider of climate finance to developing countries, is moving towards restricting its fossil fuel investments, according to Reuters.CDC Group will no longer invest in most parts of the coal, oil and gas industries, according to its recent fossil fuel policy. CDC will consider investments into gas power where there are ""large unmet energy needs"" and if these are consistent with a pathway to net zero, according to Amin.Moves by such institutions to restrict fossil fuel funding come despite the fact that the United Kingdom relies on gas for around two thirds of its electricity, while the European Union currently has €87 billion ($102 billion) worth of gas projects in the pipeline, according to a report by the Global Energy Monitor. In the United States, natural gas makes up 40% of utility-scale electricity generation, with coal, nuclear and renewables contributing about 20% each, according to the US Energy Information Administration.Solar panels on the rooftop of a street boutique in Lagos, Nigeria.Like the United States, Europe and Britain, Nigeria sees a prominent role for renewable energy, notwithstanding its investments into gas power. The government is targeting 32 gigawatts of on-grid power generation capacity by 2030, with renewables expected to contribute 43% and gas making up 41%. When off-grid capacity is included, gas and renewables will contribute roughly 30% each to planned power generation capacity of 45 gigawatts. ""In Nigeria, clean energy is central to our government's plan to transition to net-zero emissions,"" Osinbajo, the vice president, continued. ""But our citizens cannot be forced to wait for battery prices to fall or new technologies to be created in order to have reliable energy and live modern, dignified lives.""Sub-Saharan Africa is home to three quarters of the 760 million people globally without access to electricity, according to the World Bank, which expects that number to rise as a result of the pandemic. Less than half of the population has access to electricity in their homes.In Nigeria, energy poverty is itself a major driver of emissions, according to Olu Verheijen, the founder of Lagos-based energy advisory business Latimer Energy. Given how scarce and unreliable existing supply is, many households and businesses rely on diesel generators for backup energy supply, while the lack of access to modern cooking technologies is a major driver of deforestation.""If you're siting on massive reserves of gas that have already been commercialized, it makes sense to extend that existing infrastructure to satisfy energy needs, diversify the economy and lift citizens out of poverty,"" Verheijen said.Young men work on generators at a workshop in Maiduguri in Nigeria's northeast.Africa's renewables potentialThe Nigerian government's Solar Power Naija initiative — which aims to deploy 5 million new solar-based connections by 2023 — highlights how difficult it is to scale renewable solutions quickly. The program will expand energy access to 25 million individuals, delivering power to just 28% of Nigerians who don't currently have access. And while a step in the right direction, solar panels on roofs are not necessarily adequate to power large industrial businesses, which require a great deal more electricity than what's needed to switch on a light bulb or charge a cellphone.Still, renewable technology is developing at lightning speed and this can only benefit Africa. Mark Carrato, who coordinates the US Agency for International Development (USAID) Power Africa program, sees vast potential to deliver electricity to Africa in a climate smart way. Since its launch in 2013, Power Africa has delivered electricity to over 118 million people on the continent, connecting 25 million homes and businesses to on and off-grid energy solutions. More than three quarters of the transactions it has closed are based on renewable technologies.""In almost every case, project by project you see a renewables solution that is cheaper,"" he told CNN Business.Carrato argues that fossil fuels might provide short-term solutions to energy needs, but could end up taxing poorer countries in the long run through increased funding costs and the problem of ""stranded assets,"" in which infrastructure becomes obsolete as it is replaced by cleaner and cheaper renewable technologies.""The cost of capital to do fossil fuels is only going to increase,"" Carrato said.Could this startup end Nigeria's reliance on generators? On the other hand, the cost of renewable technologies is rapidly declining. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the cost of large, utility-scale solar projects decreased 82% between 2010 and 2019, while the cost of onshore wind fell by 40%. The cost of electricity storage technologies — which will be crucial to facilitating ""deep decarbonization"" including in sectors such as transport and construction — are also expected to fall considerably by 2030.Africa is well positioned to benefit. The continent's estimated potential to generate renewable energy from existing technologies is 1,000 times larger than its projected demand for electricity in 2040, according to IRENA.""Renewable energy — including green hydrogen — could replace African exports of coal, oil and gas,"" it said in a recent report with German development banks KfW and GIZ.But to leverage the potential for renewables, average annual investments in Africa's energy system must double by 2030 to approximately $65 billion.While there's good reason to be bullish on Africa's potential to leapfrog fossil fuel technologies in favor of cleaner energy sources, the kind of renewable technology that can rapidly drive industrial development — to power factories, fuel transport and logistics networks and enable the digital economy to thrive — is not yet commercially available at scale. In the meantime, some analysts argue that Africa needs reliable and affordable energy. ""It's absolutely untenable to hold the position that African countries and African people should wait until [battery] storage costs come down. That seems immoral and kind of outrageous,"" said Moss of the Energy for Growth Hub.The under-construction Dangote Industries oil refinery and fertilizer plant site outside of Lagos, Nigeria.Existing electricity grids in Africa are also fundamentally different to more advanced developed markets, which can absorb significant intermittent power. This means that in some cases, certainly for Nigeria, gas has an important role to play in providing power.""Off-grid solar is fine but it's not enough for industry, for big cities and it's definitely not going to drive the job creation that Nigeria also needs,"" added Moss. ""When we talk about energy poverty in Africa we're talking about getting poor people a lightbulb in their house,"" he continued. ""That is the first step on the energy ladder, that is not modern energy. Energy for growth is energy needed in the wider economy used outside the home that can drive higher incomes but especially job creation.""A just transitionTo put the world on track to reach net zero emissions by the middle of the century, the International Energy Agency estimates that annual clean energy investment into emerging and developing economies needs to increase more than sevenfold to $1 trillion annually by 2030.As it stands, these economies currently account for just one fifth of global investment into clean energy and pay interest rates to borrow money that are up to seven times higher than in the United States or Europe. Developed countries also remained $20 billion short of meeting a pledge to channel $100 billion per year by 2020 towards helping poor countries tackle climate change. Peak oil is coming. That won't save the world""In many emerging and developing economies, emissions are heading upwards while clean energy investments are faltering, creating a dangerous fault line in global efforts to reach climate and sustainable energy goals,"" IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a recent report.""Countries are not starting on this journey from the same place — many do not have access to the funds they need to rapidly transition to a healthier and more prosperous energy future, and the damaging effects of the Covid-19 crisis are lasting longer in many parts of the developing world,"" he added.In the race to solve the climate crisis, there's a clear risk that the development needs of poor countries are sacrificed in pursuit of global emissions goals. Nigeria could be a testing ground."

","asia, Analysis: Japan's tough talk on Russia is really about China - CNN",Japan's tough talk on Russia is really about China,"Tokyo (CNN)Japan has backed its condemnation of war in Ukraine with sanctions on Russian officials and oligarchs, but experts say they're not the only audience for Tokyo's outrage -- China is meant to get the message, too. Since Moscow attacked Ukraine, commentators have drawn comparisons between Russia's actions and China's stated ambition to seek the ""reunification"" of Taiwan with the mainland. The ""what if"" scenario has not been lost on Japanese leaders. In the first days of the invasion, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida was quick to frame the Ukraine crisis as a global issue. ""This is a very serious situation which doesn't just affect Europe, but also Asia and the whole world order,"" he told reporters.And the Japanese public seem to be in lockstep with his views. In a country typically more focused on domestic issues, the war is dominating news coverage. Thousands of anti-war protesters have taken to the streets of cities nationwide, and a recent poll shows that over 80% of the 1,063 people surveyed support Japan's economic sanctions against Russia. For Japan, support for Ukraine serves a dual purpose, according to Yoko Iwama, an international relations and security expert at the National Graduate Institute of Policy Studies. Read More""The purpose of Japan's response is to send a message that we will be ready and we will resist if there's an invasion (of Japanese territory), that we will not allow the borders to be changed by force,"" said Iwama.""We don't want a real war, the objective is political -- that China is persuaded from an aggressive act like the one that Putin has taken in the last several days and weeks.""It's against that backdrop that Japan's former prime minister, Shinzo Abe, raised a previously unthinkable suggestion during an interview three days after the Russian invasion.Abe, still an influential figure in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, floated the idea of Japan entering a NATO-like nuclear weapons sharing program -- hosting US nuclear weapons on Japanese soil. It was a shocking proposal for country that suffered the devastating impact of the two atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II -- but one Abe says should no longer be taboo. Different times, changing tacticsJapan's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine differs markedly to its actions after Moscow's attack on Crimea in 2014. Then, under Abe, Japan was called out for being too slow to act. Now its strategy is different -- and the urgency arguably greater. Back in 2014, Abe adopted the tactic of pulling Russia closer to prevent it tightening ties with China, said James Brown, an associate professor of political science at Temple University in Tokyo. Russia had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea by sending in armed forces to take over key facilities and foment a separatist rebellion that rumbled on for eight years. Tokyo initially treated Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region as a Western issue, according to Sheila Smith, a senior fellow for Asia-Pacific studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.""(The Japanese government) treated it a little bit like an issue for the Europeans and Americans to deal with; that it wasn't really about Japan, but that they'd go along with it,"" Smith said.She said Abe harbored hopes that Russian leader Vladimir Putin would sign on to the normalization of Russia-Japan ties or a full peace treaty formally ending hostilities dating back to World War II.But Japan's softer stance against Russia drew international criticism, and Tokyo eventually joined its Western allies in imposing sanctions on Russia, including diplomatic measures consisting of suspending talks related to easing visa requirements, a travel ban and the freezing of certain individuals' assets.However, this year the scale and horror of the crisis unfolding in Ukraine has prompted Japan to push a consistent message of unity with its G7 partners to show it's a ""trustworthy partner,"" according to Brown, from Temple University.""You hear time and time again, the government say -- 'and alongside our G7 and other international partners, we will coordinate in taking a tough response on this issue' -- they don't want to be seen as out of step,"" Brown said.Japan needs G7 support -- particularly from the US -- to contain any move from Beijing on Taiwan, the island which China claims as its territory despite having never governed it.  So last week, Japan added even more sanctions against Russia and Belarus -- freezing the assets of an additional 32 Russian and Belarusian officials and oligarchs. And in a rare move, it also reviewed its guidelines on the transfer of defense equipment overseas, paving the way for the transport of bulletproof vests and helmets to Ukraine. Tokyo has also joined the push to cut Russia from the SWIFT banking system and has frozen Russian leader Vladimir Putin's assets. Experts says Japan wants to keep in step with its international allies in the face of the unfolding human tragedy and China's growing military might.'Sense of urgency' For decades after World War II, Japan's pacifist constitution prevented it from building up its military strength. Article 9 of the document said that ""land, sea and air forces, as well as other war potential will never be maintained.""But in recent years, the country has signaled a move towards greater military spending, and last December Prime Minister Kishida announced the government was exploring options to give it the capability to strike enemy bases.China is considered a major threat, but the combined strength of Russia and China has put Japan under considerable pressure.Last year, the two countries conducted what was billed as the first joint China-Russia naval patrol in the western Pacific. Vessels sailed through the Tsugaru Strait that separates Japan's main island and its northern island of Hokkaido, before heading down the nation's eastern coast and then back toward China through the Osumi Strait off the southern Japanese island of Kyushu.Russia's attack on Ukraine reveals political fault lines in AsiaForeign vessels are permitted to sail through the Osumi and Tsugaru straits -- both international waters -- but Japan closely monitored the maneuvers, which the country's Defense Department called ""unusual.""Japan's Ministry of Defense said on Friday that 10 Russian Navy vessels, including a frigate, had sailed through the Tsugaru Strait the previous day, toward the Sea of ​​Japan.Japan has territorial disputes with both China and Russia. Last year, Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi told CNN the Senkaku Islands, known as the Diaoyu Islands in China, are unquestionably Japanese territory and would be defended as such. Japan also contests Russia's claim to the Kuril Islands, an island chain off Hokkaido.And then there's Taiwan, which sits to the south in waters used to ferry 90% of Japan oil supplies. Last year, Japan approved a record defense budget for 2022 of 5.4 trillion yen ($47.2 billion), which exceeded 1 percent of its GDP. Some say the Ukraine crisis on top of local security considerations shows it needs to commit even more. Breaking down taboosBut extra defense funding is just one aspect of Japan's armor against an escalation of regional tensions. Last month, Abe has used his position as former leader to raise another even more controversial prospect -- the idea of hosting US nuclear weapons in Japan. ""Japan is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has its three non-nuclear principles, but it's essential to understand how the world's security is maintained, and we shouldn't treat those discussions as a taboo,"" Abe told Fuji Television.Kishida immediately dismissed the suggestion, calling it ""unacceptable,"" while anti-nuclear activists were predictably outraged. Japan falls within the US nuclear umbrella but has long ruled out hosting nuclear weapons due to devastation wrought by atomic bombs dropped during World War II.When asked about Abe's comments in a regular press briefing, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Japanese politicians had made ""wild comments"" that ""openly violate its own Three Non-Nuclear Principles and the obligations of a party to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT).""""By raising nuclear sharing with the US, Japan has fully exposed the dangerous tendency of lingering militarism in the country,"" he added.In the interview, Abe also called for the US to take a more explicit position on the defense of Taiwan over whether or not it would defend the self-ruled island if Beijing were to attack.Last year, US President Joe Biden said the US would defend Taiwan if it were to come under attack from China, a comment that seemed incongruous with America's stated policy of ""strategic ambiguity."" However, later a government official said the US was not announcing any change to its policy on Taiwan -- under the ""One China"" Policy, the US acknowledges China's claim of sovereignty over Taiwan.One thing is clear: Russia's attack on Ukraine has rattled the Japanese and has forced them to face questions some might otherwise avoid.""People are asking, 'Will the United States really come in if the Chinese attack? Will the United States go to war with China?'"" said Smith, from the Council on Foreign Relations.""These are all recent questions that have been bubbling up under the surface, based on the capabilities first of North Korea, but also China. And I think that's also being laid bare as Putin uses nuclear threats,"" she added. Journalist Yuki Kurihara contributed to this report from Tokyo."

""We've lost a lot of leopards,"" says Watson.

A passion for wildlife Watson grew up in the city of Colombo, but ""I loved being out in wild spaces ... I have a strong affinity with animals"" she says.       (Video courtesy of Chitral Jayatilake) In 1994 she moved to Ontario, Canada, to study at McMaster University, and met her future husband, Andrew Kittle.A few years later the couple, who share a passion for wildlife, had settled in Sri Lanka. In 2000 they launched a pilot project to study leopards in Yala National Park in the island's southeast. At the time, very little was known about the elusive animals, says Watson. To protect them, it was vital to understand their lives -- and to count them. Watson and Kittle, who went on to establish the Wilderness & Wildlife Conservation Trust (WWCT) in 2004, currently work in four locations around Sri Lanka. They are investigating the size of the leopard population using remote cameras that take photos when they detect movement. Leopards that are caught on camera can be identified because each one has a unique pattern of spots -- and famously, their spots never change. Read: Google-backed project is collecting millions of wildlife camera-trap imagesInstalling the cameras is often grueling work, says Watson. It can involve long drives on spine-rattling, rocky tracks, clambering up hillsides, bushwhacking through jungle, and occasional encounters with elephants, bears and snakes, as well as leeches and ticks.Anjali Watson attaches a motion-detecting camera to a tree.Out in the field, the team collects leopard scat to find out which animals they are hunting -- leopards are not picky eaters and their diet includes deer, monkeys, wild boar, porcupines and hares. Watson hopes that WWCT's data will help to shape development plans that make space for leopards. If corridors between forest patches and buffer zones around protected areas are safeguarded, both humans and animals could thrive. Watson is dedicated to ensuring that these ""beautiful, fabulous creatures"" survive."

","asia, Wildlife flourishing in uninhabited areas around Fukushima  - CNN",Wildlife flourishing in uninhabited areas around Fukushima ,"(CNN)Nearly a decade after Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster, researchers have discovered that wildlife is thriving in the areas evacuated by humans, despite radiological contamination. On March 11, 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake hit Japan. More than 20,000 people died or went missing in the quake and tsunami, while hundreds of thousands more lost their homes. Three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant melted down, releasing radioactive materials into the air and more than 100,000 people were evacuated from the area. A Japanese serow explores the area. Scientists have now discovered that wildlife is abundant in areas that humans no longer live.Using remote cameras, researchers from the University of Georgia recovered more than 267,000 photos of more than 20 species -- including racoon dogs, wild boars, macaques, pheasants, foxes and Japanese hares in the areas surrounding the power plant.Read More""Our results represent the first evidence that numerous species of wildlife are now abundant throughout the Fukushima Evacuation Zone, despite the presence of radiological contamination,"" James Beasley, associate professor at the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory and the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources, said in a statement.Chernobyl control room now open to visitors -- but only wearing a hazmat suitPhotographic data was collected from 106 camera sites from three zones: Areas where humans were excluded due to the highest level of contamination; areas where humans were restricted due to an intermediate level of contamination; and areas where people were allowed to remain.Over 120 days, cameras captured 46,000 photographs of wild boar, with more than 26,000 images taken in the areas which were uninhabited. In contrast, about 13,000 images were taken in zones where humans were restricted due to contamination and 7,000 taken in zones inhabited by people. Researchers captured images of more than 20 species, including macaque monkeys, in the areas surrounding the plant. Researchers also saw higher numbers of racoons, Japanese marten, a weasel-like animal, and Japanese macaque or monkeys in uninhabited or restricted zones. Species considered to be ""in conflict"" with humans, such as wild boar, were predominantly photographed in areas and zones evacuated by humans, Beasley said.Inside Slavutych, the city created by the Chernobyl explosionWhile the research monitors the radiological impact on wildlife populations as a whole, it does not give an assessment on the health of individual animals, scientists noted.

In China, one company just got even closer to making it a reality.On Thursday, AutoX, an Alibaba (BABA)-backed startup, announced it had rolled out fully driverless robotaxis on public roads in Shenzhen. The company said it had become the first player in China to do so, notching an important industry milestone.Previously, companies operating autonomous shuttles on public roads in the country were constrained by strict caveats, which required them to have a safety driver inside. This program is different. In Shenzhen, AutoX has completely removed the backup driver or any remote operators for its local fleet of 25 cars, it said. The government isn't restricting where in the city AutoX operates, though the company said they are focusing on the downtown area.The company released a video of its minivan — the Fiat Chrysler Pacifica — navigating on its own through the city's downtown area, showing passengers getting in, loading a package into the backseat and letting a dog hop in for a spin. Read MoreIt also depicts the car navigating around loading trucks, veering past pedestrians, and performing a U-turn.

""It's a dream,"" AutoX CEO Jianxiong Xiao said in an interview. ""After working so hard for so many years, we've finally reached the point that the technology is mature enough, that we feel confident by ourselves, to really remove the safety driver.""Xiao said the company won over regulators after working to improve both its software and hardware. ""We have over 100 vehicles driving every day on the road [in China] to capture data,"" he said. ""The AI software is better [now.]""""From a technical point of view, the car is ready,"" Xiao said. ""It's very crucial to have this car, otherwise we cannot go driverless.""AutoX was founded in 2016 by Xiao, a former assistant lecturer at Princeton who still likes to be called ""Professor X."" The Shenzhen-based firm focuses on making the technology that goes into self-driving cars, and partners with major automakers, such as Fiat Chrysler, to develop and put out its robotaxis.The new initiative is still in trial mode and not currently open to the public. That likely won't change anytime soon, according to Xiao, who said that he hoped to obtain permission to expand the program to regular passengers in the next two or three years.Race of the robotaxiWhile AutoX has claimed an edge in China, it's not the first time fully driverless shuttles have hit public roads. This summer, the company obtained approval to carry out completely autonomous tests on public roads in parts of San Jose, California, clearing another hurdle in one of its most important markets.In October, Alphabet's Waymo went a step further, saying that it would start opening up its unmanned transportation service to members of the public in Phoenix, Arizona. (It now offers rides to passengers in the area through an app.)Domestic competition is also heating up. Recently, Chinese companies have started to let more ordinary people experience what it's like to ride in a self-driving car.'I'm not drunk, it's my car:'  Tesla's 'full self-driving' gets mixed reviewsThis year, the coronavirus pandemic demonstrated the need for contactless services, which encouraged the government to move faster with autonomous technology, said Xiao.In June, Didi, China's biggest ride-hailing firm, began offering free rides in its autonomous vehicles within a designated area of Shanghai.Recently, Chinese tech giant Baidu (BIDU) also announced that anyone could try its robotaxi service in certain districts of Beijing. Both of those programs require dedicated safety drivers.AutoX already has more than 100 robotaxis deployed in five Chinese cities, including Shanghai and Wuhan. Over the next year, it aims to double its reach to more than 10 local cities. Whether the company can pull humans from behind the wheel in other markets depends on local regulators, Xiao said.In Shanghai, its vehicles are available to public users, who can hail them through Alibaba's Autonavi app, a Chinese mapping app. Michigan plans to redesign a stretch of road for self-driving carsThe startup's latest approval from local authorities in Shenzhen came after six months of trials it had already conducted there.Some of the company's lessons so far include how to better adapt to traffic conditions in each place, according to Xiao. In Shenzhen, for instance, motorists often have to watch out for delivery workers on bikes and scooters, and drivers are known to drive more aggressively than in the United States, he said.""The traffic scenarios are much more challenging,"" he added. ""For our AI, we had to do a lot of work to adapt to the local Chinese way of driving.""China, home to the world's biggest auto sector, could someday become the top global market for automated vehicles, according to a report from consulting firm McKinsey. It projects the country could generate as much as $1.1 trillion in revenue from autonomous mobility services by 2040.The industry, however, still faces a long road ahead. Xiao estimates it could take another five years for unmanned taxis to become the norm across China.""The bar is incredibly high,"" he said. ""It's extremely challenging, but we're very happy."""

The full bench of the Federal Court handed down its unanimous ruling Tuesday, saying the duty of care should not be imposed on Environment Minister Sussan Ley, with the three judges offering multiple reasons for their decision.  Chief Justice James Allsop said liability should not be imposed, partly because the minister's lack of control over the harm caused by climate change by her decisions greatly exceeded the ""tiny contribution to the overall risk of damage from climate change"" from those decisions.""The lack of proportionality between the tiny increase in risk and lack of control, and the liability for all damaged by heatwaves, bushfires and rising sea levels to all Australians under the age of 18 ongoing into the future, mean that the duty in tort should not be imposed,"" Allsop said.Rescue volunteers patrol around the flooded houses in the Sydney suburb of Windsor, March 9.In a statement, Ley welcomed the decision and said the government would closely review the judgment. ""The Morrison Government remains committed to protecting our environment for current and future generations,"" the statement added.Read MoreTuesday's ruling followed a landmark Federal Court ruling in May 2021 that said the federal environment minister had a duty of care to consider young people before approving an extension of the Whitehaven Vickery coal mine in New South Wales.The case was brought by eight Australians under 18 years old, including Melbourne teenager Anjali Sharma, and Sister Marie Brigid Arthur, who acted as their legal guardian.In July 2021, the judgment was extended to apply to all children, not just the applicants, further increasing pressure on the government to consider risks to future Australians when it approved new coal projects.Outside the Federal Court in Sydney Tuesday, Sharma, the lead litigant in the case, said she was ""devastated by the decision and so, so angry.""Ava Princi, 18, Luca Saunders, 16, and Anjali Sharma, 17, console each other after Tuesday's ruling.   ""The Federal Court today may have accepted the minister's legal arguments over ours. But that does not change the minister's moral obligation to take action on climate change and to protect young people from the harms that it will bring. It does not change the science,"" the 17-year-old told reporters. ""It does not put out the fires or drain the flood waters.""""Our lawyers will be reviewing the judgment, and we will have more to say on possible next steps for the coming weeks, but what I can say today is that we will not stop in our fight for climate justice.""Amanda McKenzie, the chief executive of the Climate Council said the ruling was disappointing but the children succeeded in drawing more attention to an important issue.""You need a drumbeat, if you like, of information and people saying, 'this is not okay.' And I feel like the young people that pushed this case, they really created a moment to focus people's attention on what climate change means for young Australians. And I think that was really valuable,"" she said.JUST WATCHEDRecord-breaking floods hit eastern AustraliaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRecord-breaking floods hit eastern Australia 01:20The children's initial legal victory didn't stop the government from approving the Whitehaven Vickery coal mine extension. The project was approved in September and will see an open-cut coal mine developed in northwestern New South Wales.The majority of the coal mined will be metallurgical coal for steel-making, along with thermal coal for export markets, according to the Whitehaven website.The appeal was heard by Allsop, Justice Jonathan Beach and Justice Michael Wheelahan.In the ruling delivered by Allsop, Beach found the environment minister shouldn't be held responsible, partly because there wasn't ""sufficient closeness and directness between the minister's exercise of statutory power and the likely risk of harm to the respondents and the class that they represent.""Wheelahan said providing duty of a care ""did not fit"" with the minister's role under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.The Australian government is considered a laggard on climate action. In October, days before the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, Prime Minister Scott Morrison finally announced the country would join the other developed nations by aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.In recent weeks, record-breaking floods down the country's eastern coast prompted a national emergency declaration as homes and businesses were swamped after a period of heavy rain. It comes two years after fires devastated a large swathe of Australia's most populous states. Both disasters were attributed to climate change."
208,Simone McCarthy and CNN's Beijing Bureau,2022-03-10 05:35:43,news,china,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/10/china/china-russia-disinformation-campaign-ukraine-intl-dst-hnk/index.html,China's promotion of Russian disinformation indicates where its loyalties lie - CNN,"In public statements and at international summits, Chinese officials have attempted to stake out a seemingly neutral position on the war in Ukraine, neither condemning Russian actions nor ruling out the possibility Beijing could act as a mediator in a push for peace. ","china, China's promotion of Russian disinformation indicates where its loyalties lie - CNN",China's promotion of Russian disinformation indicates where its loyalties lie,"Beijing  (CNN)In public statements and at international summits, Chinese officials have attempted to stake out a seemingly neutral position on the war in Ukraine, neither condemning Russian actions nor ruling out the possibility Beijing could act as a mediator in a push for peace. But while its international messaging has kept many guessing as to Beijing's true intentions, much of its domestic media coverage of Russia's invasion tells a wholly different story. There, an alternate reality is playing out for China's 1.4 billion people, one in which the invasion is nothing more than a ""special military operation,"" according to its national broadcaster CCTV; the United States may be funding a biological weapons program in Ukraine, and Russian President Vladimir Putin is a victim standing up for a beleaguered Russia. To tell that story, major state-run news media outlets -- which dominate China's highly censored media space -- have been largely echoing Russian state media stories or information from Russian officials. A CNN analysis reviewed nearly 5,000 social media posts from 14 Chinese state media outlets during the first eight days of Russia's invasion posted onto China's Twitter-like platform, Weibo. The analysis found that of the more than 300 most-shared posts about the events in Ukraine -- which were each shared more than 1,000 times -- almost half, about 140,  were what CNN classified as distinctly pro-Russian, often containing information attributed to a Russian official or picked up directly from Russia's state media.Read MoreThe analysis, which focused on stories that got the most play on social media, may not be representative of all posts shared by state media outlets on Weibo. But it provides a snapshot of the state media-produced information that is most visible to the more than half a billion monthly users on the popular platform. It's not clear the extent to which these posts may be explicitly the result of a coordinated propaganda campaign between the two countries, but it is consistent with an ongoing pattern in which Russian and Chinese media have amplified and reinforced their often-interchangeable talking points on issues such as the treatment of Russian dissidents, Hong Kong pro-democracy protests, the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, or the supposed American role in fomenting ""color revolutions"" against authoritarian regimes.  Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping walk down the stairs as they arrive for a BRICS summit in Brasilia, Brazil in 2019.  Such mutual reinforcement has also spilled over into the extensive overseas and English-language propaganda operations that both countries have built to promote their views globally -- a route made more important with Russia's state media outlets being banned on air and online in parts of the West. In China's top-down government-controlled media environment, all state-affiliated content is vetted and issued in accordance with government directives. That China has chosen to follow Russia's lead in deliberately mischaracterizing the war only serves to underline Beijing's closeness to Moscow -- and almost makes a mockery of China's self-proclaimed impartiality in helping to engage with Russia and bring an end to the violence. The playbookRussian assurances that civilian sites will not be targeted -- despite extensive evidence to the contrary, descriptions of Ukrainian soldiers using ""Nazi"" tactics, and misinformation regarding the whereabouts of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are all stories that have been funneled from Russian sources into China's enclosed social media ecosystem -- where many Western news outlets are blocked  -- by its state media outlets in recent days. That dynamic was at play on Monday morning, when China's state broadcaster CCTV released a package in its morning newscast highlighting Moscow's erroneous claim that Washington had funded the development of biological weapons in Ukrainian labs. That insinuation is used to support the narrative that Ukraine -- characterized by Moscow as an American puppet state -- threatens Russia, and not the other way around. The source? Russian Defense Ministry Spokesman Igor Konashenkov, who on Sunday said Russian forces uncovered ""evidence"" of the ""hasty measures to conceal any traces of the military biological program finance(d) by the US Department of Defense,"" and referenced documents he said detailed the destruction of hazardous pathogens at these facilities on the order of the Ukrainian Health Ministry.  In a statement on Twitter Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki pushed back on ""Russia's false claims about alleged US biological weapons labs and chemical weapons development in Ukraine"" and noted the ""echoing"" of those ""conspiracy theories"" by Chinese officials. ""This is preposterous. It's the kind of disinformation operation we've seen repeatedly from the Russians over the years in Ukraine and in other countries, which have been debunked, and an example of the types of false pretexts we have been warning the Russians would invent,"" Psaki said, adding that the US was ""in full compliance"" with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons Convention and ""does not develop or possess such weapons anywhere.""""Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them. It's a clear pattern,"" Psaki said. The subject was also raised in a Senate hearing on Tuesday, when Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland, asked if Ukraine had biological weapons, said it has biological research facilities, which the US was concerned Russian forces may be seeking to control. ""We are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces, should they approach,"" Nuland said. Residents watch a TV screen showing news about Ukraine at a shopping mall in Hangzhou, in China's eastern Zhejiang province on February 25, 2022.Minutes after the CCTV report aired, an affiliated news outlet released an online post repeating the claims from Russia's Defense Ministry and started a related hashtag on Weibo, which began trending. The hashtag was viewed more than 45 million times over a period of hours that day. The next day, after Russia doubled down on the biological weapons claims with further statements, without evidence, CCTV released a new television segment, which was again shared by prominent state media outlets on Weibo, gaining further traction. The story then moved into the narrative of China's officials when a state media reporter at a regular Foreign Ministry press briefing asked a question about the laboratories, prompting the spokesperson to read a lengthy prepared response that repeated Russian disinformation. ""We once again urge the US to fully clarify its biological militarization activities both inside and outside its borders and accept multilateral verification,"" spokesperson Zhao Lijian said.Within hours, at least 17 state media outlets, including CCTV, Xinhua, and the People's Daily, posted Zhao's response on Weibo, where the topic racked up more than 210 million views. A related hashtag rose to be the top trending topic on Weibo by the following afternoon. The pattern is just one example of a playbook that enables China to cover the war through the lens of Russian rhetoric and disinformation. Other examples include stories, such as repeated false claims that Zelensky fled the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv -- sourced to a single Russian lawmaker, which were picked up and amplified by both Chinese and Russian state media outlets on their domestic and international platforms. A CNN analysis sought to understand how large a role such stories play in China's tightly controlled media ecosystem, first by combing through nearly 5,000 social media posts from the Weibo accounts of 14 of China's most influential state media outlets, focusing on the first eight days of the invasion and news about the events in Ukraine.Next, CNN analyzed which of those posts were the most highly engaged with, identifying more than 300 posts shared on Weibo more than 1,000 times. Of those more than 300 posts, an analysis found that nearly half showed Russia in a positive light -- a category CNN defined as news sourced solely from Russian officials or Russian media, content that describes Ukraine negatively, misinformation about Zelensky, or pro-Putin coverage. While about 140 posts showed Russia in a positive light, the analysis identified fewer than 15 posts that portrayed Ukraine positively.A look at other characterizations showed only around 90 of these posts were neutral -- for example, purely factual reports from reliable sources, news about humanitarian aid or updates on the evacuation of Chinese citizens from Ukraine.Just over a third were what CNN classified as anti-West or anti-US, for example: stories airing views that Russia was pushed to action in Ukraine by the expansion of NATO, or criticizing Western media coverage of the crisis. CNN reporters classified some posts into more than one category. A look at the distribution shows posts that depicted Russia in a positive light were more frequent than any other category.Because CNN only studied posts with high engagement, the findings may not be representative of all posts produced by state media.In response to CNN's request for comment, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Thursday the country is a victim of disinformation.""Some anti-China forces and media have fabricated too many lies, rumors and disinformation about China on issues that include the situation in Ukraine,"" it said in a statement. ""They have smeared the image of China, poisoned the media environment and misled public worldwide. Such actions are hypocritical and despicable.""The backdropThe findings contrast the apparent middle line that China has tried to walk in its international diplomacy.Though Beijing has stood apart from the Western response to Russia's invasion, with its diplomats refusing to condemn the invasion, or even call it such, and decrying Western sanctions, it has also frequently repeated that ""all countries' legitimate security concerns"" should be addressed. In a virtual summit with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for negotiations to bring about ""peaceful outcomes"" and stressed China's promises to contribute humanitarian aid to Ukraine. ""There is a difference between the way China talks to the international audience and the way it talks to the domestic audience ... for the domestic audience, it's important to preserve this partnership with Russia, because that's a political priority for Xi,"" said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow and the chair of the Russia in the Asia-Pacific Program at the Carnegie Moscow Center.He points to the increasingly close relationship between China and Russia in recent years, a strategic partnership strengthened, in part, by shared friction with the West.    ""So (China's leaders) need to shape public perceptions about this, and explain why dealing with Russia is morally justified or is the right thing to do -- and (China's media coverage) serves this purpose,"" he said. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian at a daily media briefing in Beijing, China, March 19, 2021. A glimpse into how China may seek to control its coverage was given in the days prior to the invasion, when an internal directive that was apparently accidentally shared on social media showed Chinese state media outlet Beijing News ordered its employees not to publish news reports that were ""negative about Russia or pro-West."" Beijing News did not respond to requests for comment. Maria Repnikova, director of the Center for Global Information Studies at Georgia State University, said Russia-leaning coverage was in line with historical precedent: ""Stories that are critical of Russia or are portraying Russia in an unfavorable manner are generally censored,"" she said.""As a result of that, it is expedient to use Russian state media sources because they're the ones portraying the (Ukraine) conflict with a more favorable eye or view from the Russian perspective,"" she said.Another sign of this has been which voices have been allowed to thrive on China's heavily censored social media platforms in the wake of the invasion. There, pro-Russia and anti-Western, nationalistic voices have also dominated, while there has been a suppression of pro-Ukrainian or anti-war messages on platforms and across the media landscape. One glaring example came Friday, when CCTV broadcast a speech from International Paralympic Committee President Andrew Parsons, at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Paralympic Games, in which many parts of the speech were muffled and were not translated. The offending context? Parsons' ""message of peace,"" in which he did not name Russia or Ukraine but said he was ""horrified at what is taking place in the world.""Those voices from within China who have tried to speak up -- including five history professors who penned an open letter voicing their strong opposition to ""Russia's war against Ukraine"" -- have seen their posts swiftly deleted or social accounts suspended. ""We have seen alternative, critical voices -- some subtle critique or attempts to present scenes from the war zone and talk about humanity and empathy toward Ukraine -- (but) a lot of these messages have been censored,"" said Repnikova.Social media platforms in China have taken action against extremist nationalist voices in recent weeks, with Sina Weibo ""punishing"" around 75 accounts and screening out more than 1,500 posts and video-streaming platform Douyin removing over 6,000 illegal videos, according to the state-owned Global Times. But the nationalistic voices that have dominated social media platforms fall in line with what Repnikova describes as ""a significant spike in digital nationalism, (with) the US and the West (as) the key target of this nationalistic sentiment.""Break the monopoly That nationalist sentiment -- fueled by a deep distrust of the US and concern about its role as the leading global power -- are a critical part of the glue that has firmed up the Russian and Chinese relationship in recent years. It's also filtered in the kinds of media coverage that each have shared overseas, as both Russia and China have sought to deepen their propaganda efforts, launching social media-friendly news brands in English and other languages, like China's CGTN and RT (formerly Russia Today). While experts say it's unclear if top media officials from the two countries are discussing news coverage at an operational level and some official coordination is more symbolic in nature, there is a growing push in recent years for alignment and content-sharing.A large Ukrainian flag with the slogan ""We Stand With Ukraine"" written on it in Chinese characters is seen on the outside wall of the Canadian Embassy on March 1, 2022 in Beijing, China. A number of content-sharing arrangements exist between Chinese and Russian media outlets, and the shared vision is clear: these outlets together can ""break the monopoly of Western media,"" as a Global Times report on a China-Russia media forum in 2015 put it.  Fast-forward to the crisis in Ukraine and the upside of that collaboration, for one partner anyway, is clear. In the European Union, Kremlin-backed media outlets RT and Sputnik were officially banned as of last Wednesday, with companies like Meta, parent of Facebook and Instagram, and Google's YouTube stepping in to block their content.But, on China's channels like CGTN and Global Times, which continue to operate, those Russian talking points are still getting through.Already this week, posts from those accounts have suggested Ukraine and the US have pro-Nazi leanings, repeated Russian misinformation on the laboratories, and cited Russia denying that it plans to overthrow the existing government in its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.How CNN reported this story:Since international reporting is a highly controlled and regulated industry in China, only a select number of state media organizations, such as Xinhua and CCTV, have permission to report international news. For this story, we selected 14 Chinese media accounts with nearly or more than 10 million followers on Weibo, a Twitter-like platform that reaches more than half a billion monthly users and is popular in China. These accounts included major outlets such as Xinhua, China News Service, CCTV, the People's Daily, and the Global Times. We collected all of the posts related to Russia or Ukraine via a keyword search published by these accounts between February 24 and March 3, the first eight days of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.We then examined posts that were shared more than 1,000 times and evaluated each of these — more than 300 — about their political preference. Reporters classified posts as neutral, pro-Russia, pro-Ukraine, anti-US/West and pro-China. Posts were sometimes categorized in multiple categories, such as pro-Russian and anti-West. We analyzed the source and wording of the news stories to determine their categories.Because the analysis focused on stories that got the most play on the highly-controlled social media platform, CNN's findings may not be representative of of all posts shared by state media outlets on Weibo."

Sign up here.Hong Kong (CNN Business)Will China help Russia cope with the fallout from economic sanctions?That has been the big question since Russia invaded Ukraine last week. The two nations have forged close ties in recent years, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping calling Russian President Vladimir Putin his ""best and bosom friend"" in 2019. During Putin's visit to Beijing last month, the two states proclaimed that their friendship has ""no limits.""That was before Russia launched its war in Ukraine, and was hit with unprecedented sanctions from Western countries. Now, China's ability to help its neighbor is being sorely tested. Experts say Beijing's options are limited.""China's leaders are walking a very difficult tightrope on Ukraine,"" said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a DC-based think tank. Why China won't put its economy on the line to rescue PutinBeijing has not rushed to help Russia after its economy was slammed by sanctions from all over the world. On Wednesday, Guo Shuqing, chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, said that the country won't participate in sanctions, but he didn't offer any relief either.Read MoreEarlier this week, China's foreign minister spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart, and said that China was ""deeply grieved to see the conflict"" and that its ""fundamental position on the Ukraine issue is open, transparent and consistent.""And the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a development bank backed by Beijing, said Thursday it was suspending all its activities in Russia as ""the war in Ukraine unfolds.""""China's complicated messaging suggests that Beijing will continue to blame Washington and its allies for provoking Russia,"" Singleton said.However, ""such moves will fall far short of further antagonizing the United States on account of Beijing's desire to avoid a complete breakdown in US-China relations,"" he added.Close but relatively small trading tiesBefore Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Putin had deepened his country's ties with China significantly. During his recent visit to China, the two countries signed 15 deals, including new contracts with Russian energy giants Gazprom and Rosneft. China also agreed to lift all import restrictions on Russian wheat and barley. Last year, 16% of China's oil imports came from Russia, according to official statistics. This makes Russia the second biggest supplier to China after Saudi Arabia. About 5% of China's natural gas also came from Russia last year.Russia, meanwhile, buys about 70% of its semiconductors from China, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. It also imports computers, smart phones, and car components from China. Xiaomi, for example, is among the most popular smartphone brands in Russia.As the West condemns Russia over Ukraine, Beijing strikes a different toneChina has also signed Russian banks onto its Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), a clearing and settlement system seen as a potential alternative to SWIFT, the Belgium-based secure messaging service that connect hundreds of financial institutions around the world. China and Russia share a strategic interest in challenging the West. But the invasion of Ukraine has put the friendship to the test.Friendship test""There is not yet any indication that China sees aiding Russia as worth violating Western sanctions,"" said Neil Thomas, a China analyst at Eurasia Group, adding that a ""flagrant"" defiance of those sanctions would come with a ""heavy economic punishment"" for Beijing as well. ""Beijing's much-touted lifting of import restrictions on Russian wheat was agreed before the invasion and does not indicate Chinese support,"" he said.China lifts restrictions on Russian wheat imports While Russia needs China for trade, Beijing has other priorities. The world's second largest economy is Russia's No. 1 trading partner, accounting for 16% of the value of its foreign trade, according to CNN Business' calculations based on 2020 figures from the World Trade Organization and Chinese customs data. But for China, Russia matters a lot less: Trade between the two countries made up just 2% of China's total trade volume. The European Union and the United States have much larger shares.Chinese banks and companies also fear secondary sanctions if they deal with Russian counterparts. ""Most Chinese banks cannot afford to lose access to US dollars and many Chinese industries cannot afford to lose access to US technology,"" said Thomas.According to Singleton, these Chinese entities ""could very quickly find themselves subject to increased Western scrutiny if they are perceived in any meaningful way as aiding Russian attempts to evade U.S.-led sanctions.""""Recognizing that China's economy and industrial output have been under enormous pressure in recent months, Chinese policymakers will likely attempt to strike a delicate balance between supporting Russia rhetorically but without antagonizing Western regulators,"" he added.There have been reports this week that two of China's largest banks — ICBC and Bank of China — have restricted financing for purchases of Russian commodities, in fear of violating potential sanctions. Reuters also reported Tuesday that China's coal imports from Russia have stalled because buyers couldn't secure funding from state banks worried about international sanctions. ICBC and Bank of China did not respond to a request for comment from CNN Business.Significant practical constraintsEven if China wants to support Russia in areas that are not subject to sanctions — such as energy — Beijing may face severe restrictions, experts said.The ""financial sanctions that have been imposed on Russia by the West put significant practical constraints on China's dealings with Russia even where they don't restrict them directly,"" said Mark Williams, chief Asian economist at Capital Economics, in a research note on Wednesday.Some commentators have suggested that China's CIPS could be used as an alternative by Russia, now that seven Russian banks have been removed from SWIFT. But CIPS is much smaller in size. It has only 75 direct participating banks, compared with more than 11,000 member institutions in SWIFT. About 300 Russian financial institutions are in SWIFT, while only two dozen Russian banks are connected to CIPS. The yuan is also not freely convertible, and is used less frequently than other major currencies in international trade. It accounted for 3% of payments globally in January, compared with 40% in the dollar, according to SWIFT. Even China-Russia trade has been dominated by the dollar and euro.""In practice, because CIPS is limited to payments in [yuan], it is only currently used for transactions with China. Banks elsewhere are unlikely to turn to CIPS as a SWIFT workaround while Russia is an international pariah,"" Williams said.Neither can China replace the United States in providing key technologies for Russia's needs.How significant are the US sanctions on Russia?Last week, the Biden administration announced a series of measures to restrict technological exports or foreign goods built with US technology to Russia. Russia imports mostly low-end computer chips from China, which are used in cars and home appliances. Both Russia and China rely on the United States for high-end chips needed for advanced weapons systems.""China alone can't supply all of Russia's critical needs for the military,"" a senior US administration official said at a media briefing last week, according to Reuters. ""China doesn't have any production of the most advanced technology nodes. So Russia and China are both reliant on other supplier countries and of course US technology to meet their needs.""That could lead Chinese tech companies — particularly larger ones — to exercise even more caution in potential deals with Russia.""Some small Chinese firms that do not depend on US inputs may backfill some of Russia's demand for sanctioned US technology,"" said Thomas from Eurasia Group. ""But big Chinese tech firms will be cautious to avoid the fate of Huawei, which the US government stunted by cutting its access to advanced semiconductors,"" he added."

Sign up here.Hong Kong (CNN)How to contain a runaway Covid outbreak, in a city committed to keeping cases at zero? That's the question now facing Hong Kong officials, as daily infections top 4,000, and previous fail-safe systems begin to buckle under the strain of their own uncompromising rules. For almost two years, Hong Kong had relied on a combination of stringent quarantines and sophisticated track-and-trace efforts to isolate positive cases, keeping the city comparatively virus-free -- even as the rest of the world began to loosen restrictions.  But those measures no longer appear sufficient in the face of the latest Omicron wave, which officials have described as a ""tsunami."" Hong Kong's insistence on sending all positive cases to hospital, irrespective of the severity, has led to at least one hospital being so overwhelmed it was forced to move patients on gurneys outside, lining them up in the parking lot.Read MoreMeanwhile, a raft of tightened restrictions and targeted lockdowns have led many experts and residents to question the sustainability of such an approach as the city enters the third year of the pandemic.Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam at a news conference on February 15.On Wednesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping took the unusual step of directly calling on Hong Kong officials to take ""all necessary measures,"" according to comments published on the front pages of two Chinese state-run newspapers. Xi's intervention has raised fears that further restrictions similar to those seen in mainland China, including a possible citywide lockdown, could soon follow. So far, the local government has firmly ruled out such a move, suggesting it would be impractical to confine more than 7 million people to their homes. But Xi's comments make clear that Hong Kong has little choice but to adhere to China's hard-line zero-Covid strategy -- whatever the cost.The biggest outbreak yetThe newest wave began in January, and quickly spun out of control despite authorities' increasingly desperate efforts.In mid-January, the government killed more than 2,500 hamsters and other small animals after a single Covid case was linked to a pet store, sparking widespread public outrage.Days later, a housing cluster prompted the government to lock down several buildings home to thousands of people. Soon, residents began complaining of trash piling up in the hallways, and of pay cuts for those who weren't able to work during the lockdown.In hindsight, it was an early sign of the chaos to come, and of a government unequipped for a wave of this magnitude despite having had more than two years to prepare.To date, less than 70% of the city's population has been fully vaccinated against Covid, according to government data, and vaccination rates among the elderly remain comparatively low despite vaccines being available since February 2021. Health officials push a trolley of supplies outside a locked-down residential building in Hong Kong on January 23. With numbers rising, authorities reimposed a series of familiar restrictions: closing all schools; shuttering bars, gyms, salons and numerous public spaces; suspending restaurant dine-in past 6 p.m., capping public gatherings; doubling down on a citywide mask mandate; and prohibiting more than two households to mix in private. But these measures -- part of the government's zero-Covid playbook each time a new outbreak arises -- failed to stop the surge. On Wednesday, the city reported a record 4,285 new cases. Before this wave, Hong Kong had never seen more than 200 new cases in a day.Many of the government's rules were formed with the zero-Covid goal in mind, such as hospitalization for all those who test positive for Covid -- regardless of their condition -- mandatory tests for anybody who may have been exposed, and quarantine of close contacts.Hong Kong's 'zero Covid' strategy frustrates travel-starved residentsThese rules and processes may have worked when Hong Kong was only dealing with a few dozen cases at a time -- but the scale of the latest outbreak has stretched the system to breaking point. As of Monday evening, seven of Hong Kong's 17 public hospitals had either reached or exceeded 100% inpatient bed occupancy -- leading to the makeshift outdoor wards, which could pose a problem this weekend with rain and cold temperatures expected. Long lines stretch across the city, with people waiting hours to get tested.But rather than consider different approaches, the government -- under pressure from Beijing -- has dug its heels in, more determined than ever to contain the outbreak.""At this moment, we still feel that (dynamic zero-Covid) is the best strategy for Hong Kong,"" the city's leader Carrie Lam said last week -- referring to a new label that aims to quickly suppress all outbreaks.Even before Xi's reported instructions, the Chinese central government stepped in earlier this week -- seemingly growing impatient with Hong Kong's inability to rein in the virus itself.  China will send health experts and medical supplies to Hong Kong, and help build new quarantine and isolation facilities, officials said -- bringing to mind the temporary hospitals that were constructed and operational within weeks in Wuhan, the original epicenter of the pandemic, at the start of it all.Lam has publicly welcomed the central government's support, admitting Tuesday that Hong Kong was struggling to cope with the exponential growth of cases. ""The problem we are facing is, given the magnitude, pace and severity of this fifth wave, it has outgrown our capacity,"" she said. A widening gapThough Hong Kong has been aligned with Beijing in pursuing zero-Covid, it could have taken a different route -- one now playing out in a very similar city, 1,600 miles (about 2,600 kilometers) away.Last August, Singapore -- which for years has competed with Hong Kong for the title of Asia's top international business hub -- was the first Asian country to declare it was moving away from a zero-Covid policy to living with the virus instead. It was soon followed by Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, and others.People walk in the Kreta Ayer district of Singapore ahead of the Lunar New Year on January 29.The mood in Singapore is now drastically different than in Hong Kong. A high vaccination rate and reopened travel with two dozen countries mean daily life has more or less resumed. Though cases there are spiking as well, people are able to go to the movies, meet friends at the bar, even attend sports events and live concerts. The few restrictions left -- like caps on social gatherings -- may soon be lifted too when the Omicron wave subsides, the health minister said Monday. ""Like most Singaporeans, I am looking forward to it,"" he added.But there is little of that optimism in Hong Kong, with leaders defiant even as the city's tough travel restrictions render it increasingly isolated from the world. ""With the full support of the central (Chinese) government, the government's united effort, and citizens' full support, we have to fight against this wave of the virus,"" Lam said on Tuesday. ""Surrendering to the virus is not an option."""

She was thrilled.But I explained that even though we'd be in the same city, I wouldn't be able to see her. I'd be in a strict bubble, separate from the rest of China's population. My grandma said not to worry. Just focus on your work, she said. I lived in Beijing before taking up a posting in Tokyo early in the pandemic. When I left, I wasn't sure when I'd see my grandma again. China's borders have been virtually closed for two years because of Covid, and the government has accepted limited visas for journalists. The Winter Olympics offered a rare chance for me to return to the country. Yet within the Olympic closed loop, it's as if I'm traversing the city in a glass box, unable to experience the Beijing I know. Hotels and venues are surrounded by temporary walls, fences, and security. I've gotten used to seeing workers in hazmat suits -- waiting tables, serving cocktails, or taking my Covid test.  As I watch the familiar Beijing streets zoom by through car windows -- a colorful blur of tall buildings, masked faces and delivery scooters -- I long to step out just for a moment.So when I noticed a bridge near my hotel that allowed Beijing residents to look down into the closed loop, within the temporary walls, I saw a window of opportunity to see my grandma. I dropped a location pin to my relatives, and told them that unfortunately, this was the closest we could get while I was in Beijing.Read MoreSelina Wang (left) pictured with her grandmother and her sister.Still, my grandma was delighted, arriving 20 minutes early in her nicest winter coat. I yelled Happy New Year in Mandarin as loud as I could, as she's hard of hearing, and jumped up and down. She took off her mask and smiled broadly, her face crinkling at the edges. Our meeting was emblematic of the isolation the world has dealt with since the pandemic began. Early on, I was separated from my husband for nine months. I didn't see my parents for more than two years. I spent months and months in various quarantines in Asia.Now, even though I was finally back in the same city as my grandma, literally just meters away from her during the Lunar New Year holiday, I couldn't embrace her. Tears started to well. It was overwhelming to see her face from a distance.I took out my phone to video call her so she could hear me properly. How ironic it was that even in our face-to-face meeting, we still had to resort to a virtual call to communicate. Grandma told me she was mostly staying at home for the holidays, as there were no festivities to attend in Beijing because of Covid. 





""Even though I was finally back in the same city as my grandma, literally just meters away from her during the Lunar New Year holiday, I couldn't embrace her.""

She recently relocated from Henan to live with relatives in Beijing to have heating in the wintertime. She was grateful for the warmth and was comfortable -- albeit sometimes lonely -- at home. Despite the joy I felt in seeing my grandma, the tears continued to flow. It was a cathartic emotional release. She's my last living grandparent, and it was heartening to see that despite the tumult of the last few years, she's safe and healthy.

See the difference 02:43Olympic sacrificesThroughout the pandemic, China has sealed off entire communities or cities over even a single Covid case. In some cities, like in Wuhan and Xi'an, residents have endured draconian measures. At the same time, for many locals like my grandma, who haven't lived in cities with major outbreaks, the strict Covid rules are just a way of life. They've accepted the restrictions, preferring the sporadic lockdowns and confinement to the skyrocketing numbers of death they see reported elsewhere. Beijing's Olympic 'bubble' will be the most ambitious Covid quarantine ever attempted. Will it work?I spoke to one of the Covid testers stationed outside my hotel. He sits in a small cubicle the size of a phone booth, wearing a hazmat suit, mask and face shield. Through the plexiglass, he told me that during his shifts that last at least six hours he cannot drink, eat, or use the bathroom. To prevent himself from needing to relieve himself, he doesn't eat before his shift starts. He says it's difficult to be away from his six-year-old son for so long, but he manages to video call him every day. Despite the grueling work, he said it's all worth it to be a part of the Games. On Lunar New Year's Day, I saw little festivities. The only reminder was the red lanterns that dotted the trees outside the media center. That day, I noticed an Olympic worker standing at the edge of the closed loop, waving to her two young sons behind layers of barricades and fences. Her sons gripped the fence, yelling to their mother that they missed her and wished they could be together for the New Year. It was a touching moment that inspired me to meet my grandma the following day. A security guard keeps watch at the boundary of the Beijing Olympic bubble on January 25.The woman told me this was the longest she'd ever been apart from her kids. Once in a while, they would meet at the edge of the park and wave to each other from afar.  Local Chinese staff have been in the Olympic bubble since early January and will stay in it through the end of the Paralympic Games. After that, they're required to quarantine for as long as 21 days at a government facility. Especially on Lunar New Year Day, she said it made her tearful to think about how close she was to her children, yet unbearably far.  I heard similar stories over and over again from drivers, security guards, restaurant waiters, and volunteers in the Olympic closed loop. They've all decided to live separately from their families for months, in order to be part of the Olympics. Some are frustrated by the confinement -- disappointed they can't get closer to the Olympic action. But most of them told me they're proud and excited to help make the event happen, brushing off the personal sacrifice. A young Selina Wang and her sister with their grandparents.Worlds apartFor my grandma, the pandemic times are just a small chapter in her life beset with struggle and sacrifice. She survived The Great Leap Forward in China, when tens of millions died from famine. When she was pregnant with my father, she had to subsist on porridge, tree leaves and tree bark to piece enough nutrition to survive. My father grew up in similarly challenging conditions. He remembers the Lunar New Year as one of the rare moments growing up when his belly was full. My parents attended graduate school in America, where they settled down and raised me and my sister. My grandma and grandpa, who were farmers in China, came to the US to care for us until I was in elementary school, while my parents worked. Grandpa walked me to school every day. Grandma's handmade dumplings and noodles were sitting on the table when I came home. Grandpa turned our backyard into a vegetable garden. Grandma sat by my bedside when I struggled to fall asleep. They taught me to read and write Chinese. I even spoke Mandarin with a villager's countryside accent. 





""But increasingly, China's rise is at odds with America's — and many democratic nations' — dream for the world.""

As I looked at my grandma from afar, I could see an expression of pride on her face. In her eyes, I had succeeded as the product of the American Dream and her other ""grand"" children in China were living through China's rise.  Increasingly, China's rise is at odds with America's -- and many democratic nations' -- dream for the world. The China my grandma lives in now is far wealthier and more powerful than the impoverished country she raised my father in. It's also become increasingly authoritarian and intolerant of dissent. The United States and its allies have boycotted the Games as a statement against allegations of human rights abuses that Beijing vehemently denies. Tensions are growing between China and numerous countries.  Surveillance and censorship mechanisms have also become more sophisticated. I've grown accustomed to seeing some of my television reports censored in real time on TV screens in China. Selina Wang as a child, pictured with her family.At the Olympics, the pandemic has also given China the ability to closely monitor and track participants, including journalists. The restrictions we face reflect a country that has become more hostile to journalists, free speech, and generally any criticism of China.  In that environment, it's harder than ever to tell stories about Chinese people. Many are fearful of retribution for speaking to Western media, even on non-sensitive topics. The woman I spoke to in the Olympic bubble on New Year's Day -- the one who was meeting her children -- asked me not to use her name or show her face on camera, worried about the consequences of sharing her story.  That sentiment makes it harder for the world to learn about the rich and multifaceted lives of China's 1.4 billion people. As I watched my Grandma's peaceful expression from the bridge above, I told her I couldn't wait to eat her dumplings again. I wanted to give her a big hug and climb over that wall -- the barrier between us, symbolic of a nation increasingly separated from the world, even for the people who want to see the country and its residents thrive."

Those were the words of Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg last month as he announced the first nationwide vaccine mandate in Europe. ","europe, Why Europe's fight against the pandemic is about to get much more dangerous - CNN",Why Europe's fight against the pandemic is about to get much more dangerous ,"Paris (CNN)""Despite months of persuasion, despite intensive media campaigns, despite discussions in various media we have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated."" Those were the words of former Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg last month as he announced the first nationwide vaccine mandate in Europe. Now, Germany looks set to follow where Austria has led. Others have made vaccines mandatory for parts of the population and imposed restrictions that increasingly explicitly target the unvaccinated, as Europe battles the twin challenges of sharply rising Covid figures and plateauing vaccination rates. Nearly one year into the EU's vaccination campaign, and with around one in three Europeans still unvaccinated, it is not so much hesitancy that European governments are now facing as outright opposition, with the danger that as governments get tougher so too will popular anger towards them. The crucial question of trustRead MoreOnly 19% of Europeans include their government among their most trusted sources of reliable information on Covid-19 vaccines, according to a survey conducted in May 2021 by the European Barometer, a collection of cross-country public opinion surveys conducted regularly on behalf of the EU's institutions.Even before the pandemic, vaccine hesitancy in Europe was strongly correlated to a populist distrust of mainstream parties and governments. One study published in the European Journal of Public Health in 2019 found ""a highly significant positive association between the percentage of people in a country who voted for populist parties and the percentage who believe that vaccines are not important and not effective."" What the pandemic has provided is a Europe-wide real-time test of that correlation. Nearly two years in and with most countries having exhausted what means they had of encouraging people to get vaccinated, the map of those who remain unvaccinated shows that where there is distrust in government and traditional political parties -- as measured by the strength of populist movements -- many people have yet to get vaccinated.Essentially, people who trust institutions need no convincing in the face of a pandemic; people who don't are unlikely to be influenced at all. Bodies pile up outside hospital morgue as Romania struggles with fourth wave of CovidEastern Europe is where vaccination rates are the lowest. Bulgaria has the lowest rate of all, with just 26.6% of the total population vaccinated, according to government data. The country has also been going through a major political crisis with three parliamentary elections held this year. Difficulties with vaccine rollouts and in reaching more remote and elderly rural populations are also to blame in Eastern Europe, but in some of the countries where vaccine take-up has been lowest, populist parties are either in power or strong electorally. Further west, lower vaccination rates are also to be found in countries and regions with either popular or voluble populist or extremist movements, as in Germany, Austria and Northern Italy.In a paper published by the journal Psychological Medicine in October, Michele Roccato and Silvia Russo from the University of Turin argue that their study shows ""people with a populist orientation tend to refuse the Covid-19 vaccine, in line with previous research showing that vaccine refusal is often politicized, but that its politicization is not limited to the traditional left-right cleavage."" A new common enemySophie Tissier, who organizes protests against Covid-19 restrictions and vaccines in France, says that these protests have created a new political force that is radical but goes beyond party political lines. She says her group seeks to ""create a citizens' opposition which is beyond electoral considerations and much more like a watchdog that sits outside the world of politics to be able to tell it: 'Look here, you are no longer protecting our rights, you are no longer protecting our rights under the law.'"" Demonstrators march during a protest against coronavirus measures in Brussels, Belgium, on December 5, 2021.In August, more than 230,000 people took to the streets across the country in one day after France became one of the first European countries to announce the use of relatively strict vaccine passes.""It really set things alight because people realized that life as it was, was coming to an end,"" she said. ""People would no longer be free, or able to go out as they did.""Since then, protests have tapered off in France, partly because no mainstream party has been openly encouraging its supporters to join them. France's vaccine rates are among the highest in Europe, suggesting that even in countries where there is strong vaccine hesitancy -- as there was in France even before the pandemic -- far-right or populist parties' stance on the vaccine can have an impact. Elsewhere in Europe, such groups are clearly fanning the anti-vaccination flames. In Austria, several protests planned since the government announced its nationwide vaccine mandate last month have been planned by the far-right Freedom Party.The mandate is due to come into force in February 2022.Even as he announced the move, Schallenberg accused the Freedom Party of being responsible for the country's low vaccination rates and of having stirred up vaccine hesitancy. ""We have too many political forces in this country that are fighting against [vaccination] vehemently, massively and publicly. That is irresponsible,"" Schallenberg said, adding: ""Incited by these radical opponents of vaccination, by specious fake news, unfortunately too many of us have not been vaccinated. The consequence is overcrowded intensive care units and enormous human suffering.""The world has the tools to end the coronavirus pandemic. They're not being used properlyIn other European countries, populist parties have also jumped on the bandwagon. And the divide in opinion over pandemic measures is no longer about extreme left and extreme right, said French political scientist Jean-Yves Camus, but ""between the mainstream and the periphery."" ""It's much more about the extreme,"" Camus said. ""The most extreme fringe groups taking advantage of the pandemic to say: 'This virus is fake, there is no pandemic and you are being tricked by your governments. It's a worldwide conspiracy of your national governments. They are using the pandemic to infringe on your individual rights and using vaccination passes to have your personal data,' and so on."" In parts of Eastern Europe, but also in and around Germany -- from Northern Italy to the Netherlands and Austria -- parties which once focused on immigration or Europe have been tapping into the widespread anger of those opposed to vaccines and Covid-19 restrictions, shifting their attention to an issue far more likely to appeal to the apolitical and to cut across traditional party political lines. Their new enemy is far more federating: The Covid-19 measures and vaccination campaigns that they say threaten their freedom. A protester wearing a mask depicting syringes applauds in Geneva, Switzerland, on October 9, 2021, during a rally against coronavirus measures.Vaccine mandatesThe World Health Organization has cautioned against vaccine mandates, because of their potential impact on public confidence and public trust. Dr Hans Kluge, WHO's Europe Director, said they should be used as ""an absolute last resort, and only applicable when all other feasible options to improve vaccine uptake have been exhausted.""In a part of the world where the fight against the pandemic has already been hampered by vaccine hesitancy, such mandates could fuel more resistance. ""The worry is that anti-vaxxers could come to hold even more extreme positions,"" said Russo, of the University of Turin. ""That's one risk. But we should also consider that where vaccines become mandatory, there will need to be controls and that could further undermine institutional trust. ""In other words, forced vaccination might push people into vaccination centers but it will also drive some of them to the streets, confirming and further fueling their deeply held suspicion of ""the system."" The fight against the pandemic may one day come to an end, but the fight against populism in Europe could be just beginning."

","politics, Fact check: A look at Biden's first year in false claims - CNNPolitics",Fact check: A look at Biden's first year in false claims,"Washington (CNN)When President Joe Biden passingly said in a voting rights speech last week that he had been ""arrested"" in the context of the civil rights movement -- even suggesting this had happened more than once -- it was a classic Biden false claim: an anecdote about his past for which there is no evidence, prompted by a decision to ad-lib rather than stick to a prepared text, resulting in easily avoidable questions about his honesty.   Biden's imaginary or embellished stories about his own history were the most memorable falsehoods of his first year in office. They were not, however, the only ones. The President also made multiple false claims about important policy matters, notably including three subjects that occupied much of his time: the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the economy and the Covid-19 pandemic. And Biden was incorrect on numerous occasions when ad-libbing about a wide assortment of facts and figures -- sometimes in a way that appeared inadvertent, but other times in a way that helped him make a political point.   Unlike his uniquely dishonest predecessor, Biden did not bury fact-checkers in a daily avalanche of serial falseness. Biden never came close to making a dozen false claims in a single speech, let alone five dozen false claims in one address, as Trump once did. In fact, the total number of Biden false claims so far is in the dozens, while Trump delivered well over 1,000 total false claims in his own first year and more than 3,000 the next year. Read MoreSo Biden is no Trump. With that said, dozens of false claims from the President of the United States is not nothing. And considering that Biden added dozens more claims that were misleading or lacking in important context, he provided more than enough material to keep fact-checkers on their toes. Here is a roundup of Biden's first year in inaccuracy. The White House declined to comment for this article; it has previously commented for individual fact checks on some of the false claims we are discussing again below.False claims about his own pastBiden made a series of claims about his own past that were just not true. It was these easy-to-understand, hard-to-defend personal falsehoods -- more than his false claims about complex policy issues or obscure statistics, which supporters could more easily dismiss as good-faith errors -- that provided the best ammunition for opponents looking to portray him as deceptive.And like some of Trump's tall tales about his past, Biden's tended to be peripheral to his message. In other words, he was hurting his reputation for little possible gain.While talking in November to technical college students standing near a truck, Biden claimed, ""I used to drive a tractor-trailer,"" though only for ""part of a summer."" This was similar to something he had said at a Mack Trucks facility in July, when he claimed, ""I used to drive an 18-wheeler, man,"" adding, ""I got to."" There is no evidence Biden ever drove a big truck; the White House previously noted to CNN that he once had a job driving a school bus (which is not an 18-wheeler or a tractor-trailer) and that, as a senator in 1973, he spent a night riding in a cargo truck (not driving it).Biden repeatedly told a story about a supposed conversation during his vice presidency with an old friend, an Amtrak train conductor, that could not possibly have happened because the man was dead at the time. He repeatedly boasted that he had traveled ""17,000 miles"" with Chinese President Xi Jinping, though that number is not even close to correct.Biden distracted from his voting rights message with the baseless claim last week, which he had made before, about having been arrested during a civil rights protest; in some of the previous versions of the story, he had merely claimed a police officer had taken him home from a protest. (There is evidence Biden participated in some civil rights activities in his youth but no record of any arrest.) And Biden told two different inaccurate stories while trying to emphasize his connection to the Jewish community. The 7 most important lines from Joe Biden's news conferenceAt a September event in honor of the High Holy Days, Biden told Jewish leaders that he remembered ""spending time at"" and ""going to"" Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue, the site of an antisemitic massacre in 2018; he had spoken by phone to the synagogue's rabbi in 2019 but never went. At a Hanukkah event in December, Biden claimed that late Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir had invited him to meet with her during the Six-Day War of 1967 (he actually met with her weeks before the Yom Kippur War six years later) and, more significantly, that she had wanted him to be ""the liaison between she and the Egyptians about the Suez, and so on and so forth."" There is zero evidence Meir ever wanted to use a 30-year-old rookie US senator as a ""liaison"" with a major adversary. False claims about AfghanistanBiden was bedeviled over the summer by his chaotic withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. And he made a variety of false claims as he tried to defend his handling of the situation -- further undermining his authority on an issue on which he was already struggling to persuade the public.In August, the President said, ""What interest do we have in Afghanistan at this point, with al Qaeda gone?"" Al Qaeda had been degraded in Afghanistan, but it wasn't ""gone"" -- as a Pentagon spokesman acknowledged on camera that same day. In an interview that week, Biden defended the US withdrawal in part by claiming that the concept of nation-building in Afghanistan ""never made any sense to me"" -- though, in fact, he had explicitly advocated nation-building in the early years of the war, both in Afghanistan and more broadly.In July, when Biden was under pressure to quickly relocate Afghans who had assisted US troops, he said ""the law doesn't allow"" Afghan translators to come to the US to await the processing of their visa applications. But experts in immigration law immediately said this wasn't true, given the administration's authority to grant ""parole,"" and, indeed, the Biden administration ended up using parole later in the summer to do what Biden had claimed wasn't permitted. In December, Biden said in another interview that ""I've been against that war in Afghanistan from the very beginning."" While he eventually grew opposed to the war, he was not against it from the start -- as fact-checkers pointed out when he had made similar remarks during his presidential campaign.  False claims about the economyThe state of the economy was a key rhetorical battleground between Biden and his critics: He argued it was thriving; they argued it was failing. And although both sides often cited valid data points, the President also made some false claims to bolster his case.Biden occasionally overstated progress and understated problems. Asked at a CNN town hall in July about inflation in automobile prices, he claimed that the cost of a car was ""kind of back to what it was before the pandemic""; the cost had actually increased substantially since late 2019 and early 2020. In an economic speech in November, he greatly exaggerated the extent of the decline in the unemployment rate during his tenure.To try to sell his economic policies, Biden sometimes made inaccurate statements about what experts had said about them. In May alone, he falsely claimed that there was a consensus among economists about how many jobs his American Jobs Plan would create, significantly overstated how many jobs the firm Moody's Analytics in particular predicted the plan would create and falsely claimed that the last five leaders of the Federal Reserve had said the plan would produce economic growth -- wrongly describing both the contents and the authorship of an article that was actually written by five former Internal Revenue Service chiefs. Later in the year, Biden misleadingly framed another Moody's jobs estimate. And he repeatedly omitted the key phrase ""longer-term"" from an assertion by Nobel-winning economists that his $1.9 trillion Build Back Better agenda would ""ease longer-term inflationary pressures"" -- leaving Americans to believe that these economists might have said his agenda would reduce the inflation hurting their bank accounts today.False claims about the Covid-19 pandemicMany of Biden's first-year speeches were devoted to the Covid-19 pandemic. Biden was almost incomparably more accurate on this subject than Trump was, tending to factually convey the severity of the situation rather than match his predecessor's fantastical rhetoric about how bad numbers were not actually bad numbers and how the virus would just disappear. But Biden made a smattering of false claims on this topic, too.At the CNN town hall in July, Biden made the inaccurate categorical promise that ""you're not going to get Covid"" if you're vaccinated. It was clear even before the emergence of the Omicron variant that vaccinated people were still getting infected with the virus, though the vaccines made them much less likely to get seriously ill; vaccinated people on the President's own staff had been infected. Biden also went too far at the town hall when he categorically pledged that ""if you're vaccinated, you're not going to be hospitalized, you're not going to be in the ICU unit and you're not going to die""; these outcomes happen, too, though they are much less common among vaccinated people. Biden sometimes exaggerated on the subject of his administration's work to get Americans vaccinated -- misleadingly playing down the Trump administration's own vaccine purchases and, in May, overstating how the US vaccination rate compared with those of the rest of the world. And he made various errors in discussing pandemic-related facts and figures.In February, Biden claimed that ""suicides are up"" amid the pandemic; experts said at the time that the claim was premature, and it turned out to be wrong (though suicide rates did increase for some specific demographic groups). In October, the President wrongly told Americans that there were ""over 800,000"" vaccination sites in the country; he had added an extra 0 to the correct figure he usually used, 80,000.False claims in unscripted settingsWhen Biden stuck to prepared speeches vetted by his staff, he tended to be factual (though certainly wasn't perfect). When he ad-libbed or participated in unscripted exchanges with journalists and citizens, he was more likely to sprinkle in inaccuracies -- making false or misleading claims about everything from his handling of the situation at the southern border to Virginia political history to gun laws to the size of a tax break for people who own racehorses.During Biden's first 100 days in the Oval Office, he was repeatedly incorrect or misleading in describing the actions of the Trump administration. And he made one particularly notable misleading claim during that early period. At a heated moment of the national debate over Georgia Republicans' new elections law, Biden did a television interview in which he criticized the law in part by misstating what it says."

And for a whole year now, the insurrection itself has been lied about. Donald Trump supporters' violent attack on the Capitol has been the subject of a dishonesty campaign that began amid the fog of January 6 and escalated even as the facts became clearer. Trump, some right-wing media figures and some Republican members of Congress have mounted a sustained effort to rewrite the history of that deadly day.They have falsely claimed all of the rioters were unarmed. They have falsely claimed the people at the Capitol merely held a ""protest"" against an election they falsely claimed was fraudulent. They have falsely claimed the rioters were welcomed into the Capitol by police officers.They have falsely claimed the riot was orchestrated by left-wing groups or the FBI. And they have falsely claimed nonviolent rioters are being jailed as ""political prisoners.""Here is a fact check of five of the most enduring lies about January 6.Read MoreLie: The rioters were completely unarmedTrump and some of his allies continue to claim that all of the people at the Capitol on January 6 were unarmed.In a December 21 statement, Trump called January 6 a ""completely unarmed protest."" Similarly, in a tweet on December 17, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia wrote, ""One of the biggest holes in the lie about J6 being a planned insurrection is that all the people there were unarmed. Anyone with half a brain knows that gun owners only leave their firearms at home when they don't feel the need to carry a gun or are obeying the law."" Facts First: It's not even close to true that all of the people at the Capitol on January 6 were unarmed -- and the claim is still false even if it is specifically about guns. People who illegally entered Capitol grounds during the insurrection were armed with a wide variety of weapons, including guns, stun guns, knives, batons, baseball bats, axes and chemical sprays. The Department of Justice said in an official update last week that so far ""over 75"" people charged in connection to the attack ""have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon."" We may never get a complete inventory of the concealed weapons the rioters possessed on January 6, since nearly all of the rioters were able to leave the Capitol without being detained and searched. But prosecutors have alleged that some of the people present at the Capitol were armed with guns, as were some other Trump supporters who traveled to Washington for January 6.Mark Mazza of Indiana has been charged with crimes including possession of a firearm on Capitol grounds; he has pleaded not guilty. According to the Capitol Police, Mazza accidentally dropped his loaded revolver during a struggle with police on a Capitol terrace. He allegedly told investigators later that if he had visited House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that day, ""you'd be here for another reason.""Guy Reffitt of Texas has been charged with crimes including illegally carrying a semi-automatic handgun on Capitol grounds; he has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors allege Reffitt ""specifically targeted at least two lawmakers -- the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, and then-Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell -- whom he sought to physically remove or displace from the Capitol building."" And police allege Christopher Alberts of Maryland was arrested trying to flee Capitol grounds on January 6 with a loaded pistol; he has pleaded not guilty.Mark Ibrahim, who was an off-duty special agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration at the time of the riot, has been charged with crimes including carrying a firearm on Capitol grounds. Ibrahim, who has said he was later fired by the DEA (the DEA would confirm to CNN only that he no longer works there), was photographed that day displaying what appeared to be a handgun. He has pleaded not guilty. In addition, Lonnie Coffman of Alabama, who pleaded guilty to weapons charges in November, admitted that he had carried two loaded pistols in Washington on January 6 and that a truck he had parked blocks from the Capitol contained additional loaded guns, Molotov cocktails and other weapons. Cleveland Meredith Jr., who pleaded guilty to threatening to kill Pelosi and was sentenced to 28 months in prison, drove from Colorado to Washington with a rifle and handgun that were found in his trailer outside a Washington hotel. The FBI said Meredith had told agents he had tried to get to Washington on January 5 but ended up arriving late on January 6.Lie: The rioters were merely protesting a 'rigged' election Trump called on his supporters to come to Washington on January 6 for a ""wild"" protest against President Joe Biden's victory, which Trump falsely claimed was fraudulent. During his rally speech on the morning of January 6, Trump pushed that election lie, directed supporters to march to the Capitol and urged them to ""fight like hell.""After the insurrection, Trump continued to repeat the election lie for months -- and adapted it to minimize what had happened at the Capitol. In an October statement, he claimed that the ""real insurrection"" was the 2020 election and January 6 was simply a ""day of protesting."" (He also made similar claims later in the year.)Facts First: Both parts of Trump's claim are obvious lies. The election wasn't rigged and wasn't fraudulent; Biden won fair and square; there was a tiny smattering of voter fraud that was nowhere near widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state, let alone to have reversed Biden's 306-232 victory in the Electoral College. And the insurrection of January 6 -- in which approximately 140 police officers were assaulted and the peaceful transfer of power was violently interrupted -- involved thousands of alleged crimes; it was, very clearly, no mere protest.""This was not a peaceful protest. Hundreds of people came to Washington, DC, to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power,"" Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court said last January. Howell added in October: ""The rioters attacking the US Capitol on January 6th, as part of a large mob, were not mere trespassers engaging in protected First Amendment protests; they were certainly not tourists. And I say that again and again because there still seems, in some areas, to be a debate about that issue."" Lie: The rioters were invited into the Capitol by police A common refrain from January 6 rioters, and some of their Republican defenders, is that they were welcomed into the Capitol by police officers. Trump said in a book interview in March that ""the Capitol Police were ushering people in"" and ""the Capitol Police were very friendly. You know, they were hugging and kissing."" The claim has been echoed by Trump supporters. For example, Trump-endorsed Republican Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake declared at a Trump rally in October that the people being held in jail over the Capitol attack ""were invited in by Capitol Police.""Facts First: The claim that the rioters were invited into the Capitol is false. Again, about 140 police officers were assaulted while trying to stop the mob from breaching the Capitol. There were hours-long battles between police and rioters near some entrances. CNN obtained footage from police body-worn cameras showing how dozens of officers engaged in hand-to-hand combat with rioters in a desperate effort to keep them out of the building.Rioters inside the Capitol after breaching barricades on Jan. 6, 2021. There are plenty of instances where rioters waltzed into the Capitol without a fight, but only after they had stormed past barricades and, in some cases, even stepped through broken windows. In some areas, police were so outnumbered by the mob that they retreated, stood aside or tried to politely engage with rioters to de-escalate the situation rather than fighting or making arrests, but that is clearly not the same as welcoming rioters into the building. Since we don't have video of every single encounter between police and rioters, it's theoretically possible that some tiny number of officers did invite rioters in. The Capitol Police announced in September that three officers were facing discipline for unspecified noncriminal ""conduct unbecoming"" that day, while three others were facing discipline for other policy violations. But no evidence has publicly emerged to date of even one officer inviting a rioter into the Capitol. And even if a few isolated incidents emerge in the future, it's clear that this was not a widespread or systemic occurrence as Trump and others suggested.Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger said on CNN in September: ""The officers that we have investigated and disciplined, the cases that we investigated, they run from minor infractions to officers making very poor judgments for more serious misconduct. But this notion that the Capitol Police were somehow allowing these folks into the Capitol, inviting them in, helping them, just simply not true."" Lie: The jailed rioters are nonviolent political prisoners One of the most prevalent counternarratives about January 6 is that a large number of nonviolent people who were present at the Capitol are being unfairly prosecuted by liberal zealots at the Justice Department, and that these nonviolent people have now become ""political prisoners"" while awaiting trial in jail. Such claims have emerged as a rallying cry among a small but vocal cohort of Trump loyalists in the House Republican conference.Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar claimed in July that jailed rioters who had supposedly spent time in solitary confinement ""are not unruly or dangerous, violent criminals"" but are ""political prisoners who are now being persecuted""; he suggested that there are ""nearly 200"" nonviolent Capitol participants behind bars. And the pro-Trump group behind September's ""Justice for J6"" rally said its event was meant ""to bring awareness and attention to the unjust and unethical treatment of nonviolent January 6 political prisoners.""Facts First: This ""political prisoners"" narrative is false. The vast majority of the 700-plus people charged in the Capitol riot to date were released shortly after their arrests. Only a few dozen were ordered by judges to remain in jail before trial, and most of those defendants were charged with attacking police or conspiring with far-right militia groups. It's true that the conditions are poor at the Washington jail where incarcerated rioters are being held. And it's obviously unpleasant for anyone to live behind bars. But the small subset of January 6 defendants who are currently in jail are there only because a federal judge ruled that they are either too dangerous to release or pose a flight risk. The decision to keep them incarcerated was not made by Biden's political appointees or any other Justice Department officials.A few rioters have claimed in court that they are the victims of politically motivated prosecution because they support Trump. Federal judges, including those appointed by Trump, have rejected these arguments. Lie: January 6 was a false flag attackBefore the Capitol was even cleared of rioters on January 6, some prominent Trump supporters started to try to deflect blame -- claiming that left-wing Antifa, a loose collection of self-described anti-fascists, was actually behind the violence. Such ""false flag"" theories -- that the violence was secretly orchestrated by Trump's opponents in an attempt to make Trump look bad -- never went away. And the theories have expanded to include claims that the violence was orchestrated by the Black Lives Matter movement or even by an arm of the federal government itself, the FBI. Fox News host Tucker Carlson has promoted false flag theories, focusing on the FBI, both in his own remarks and in his revisionist documentary series on a Fox streaming service in November. Carlson has claimed on his show that government documents showed that ""FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on January 6."" Former Army Capt. Emily Rainey said in the documentary (and in a trailer Carlson tweeted out): ""It is my opinion that false flags have happened in this country, one of which may have been January 6."" And Trump himself has given oxygen to the theories, claiming in a December interview with ring-wing commentator Candace Owens, ""You have BLM and you had Antifa people, I have very little doubt about that, and they were antagonizing and they were agitating."" Facts First: The insurrection at the Capitol was not a false flag. Just as it looked on January 6, a mob of diehard Trump supporters stormed the building. They did so after Trump urged supporters to come to Washington and then, as we noted above, made a speech urging them to ""fight like hell"" and to march to the Capitol. The rioters' allegiance to Trump has been exhaustively documented in court proceedings and in their social media posts and media interviews. Though there are thousands of pages of court documents stemming from criminal cases against January 6 rioters, no Capitol riot defendant as of the end of 2021 had any confirmed involvement in Antifa or Black Lives Matter groups. (One defendant who filmed the riot had expressed support for Black Lives Matter but was disavowed in 2020 by BLM activists, some of whom suspected he was a provocateur connected to the political right.) By contrast, hundreds of Capitol riot defendants were confirmed to be Trump supporters -- and some were members of far-right extremist groups. Members of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys have been charged with conspiracy regarding January 6; some have pleaded guilty.Carlson wrongly described the court documents he inaccurately claimed were a smoking gun about FBI operatives organizing the attack; you can read more about that claim here. While it is entirely possible that some of the Capitol rioters were secretly serving as informants for the FBI -- The New York Times reported in October that a member of the Proud Boys who had entered the Capitol on January 6 was an FBI informant -- the presence of a few FBI informants among the estimated 2,000-plus people who illegally breached the Capitol would not make the entire mob assault an FBI-orchestrated ""false flag"" operation. Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, vice chair of the House select committee investigating the insurrection, said on Fox News in November that there is no truth to claims that January 6 was a false flag perpetrated by ""deep state"" liberals trying to set up Trump supporters. ""It's the same kind of thing that you hear from people who say that 9/11 was an inside job, for example. It's un-American to be spreading those kinds of lies, and they are lies,"" Cheney said.CNN's Holmes Lybrand and Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this article."

","politics, Anatomy of a lie: How the myth that Antifa stormed the Capitol became a widespread belief among Republicans - CNNPolitics",Anatomy of a lie: How the myth that Antifa stormed the Capitol became a widespread belief among Republicans,"Washington (CNN)FBI Director Christopher Wray was live on CNN and MSNBC when he told a Senate committee hearing on Tuesday morning that the FBI had not yet found any evidence that subscribers to the Antifa movement were involved in the January attack on the US Capitol. At that moment, Fox News was in a commercial break from its regular programming. It had just urged viewers to stay tuned for a segment about educators ""canceling"" Dr. Seuss. And so America's most popular right-wing television network again missed a chance -- or, perhaps, again chose to miss a chance -- to confront its viewers with the debunking of a lie that has become a widespread belief among right-wing Americans.In part because of Fox, the conspiracy theory has become pervasive in conservative circles. Opinion polls suggest that a large percentage of Republicans baselessly think that Antifa was primarily responsible for the insurrection that was actually perpetrated by supporters of former President Donald Trump, some of whom have allegedly expressed irritation that Antifa has been given the credit for their own behavior.In a January poll by the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank, 50% of Republicans said Antifa was mostly responsible for the violence at the Capitol. A January poll by NBC found that 48% of Republican registered voters thought Antifa was solely or mainly responsible for the Capitol riot. Read MoreThe problem is bigger than FoxFox News deserves part of the blame for this worrying state of affairs. Some of its most prominent personalities have given fuel to the lie. Other Fox personalities have joined Trump in generally overhyping the danger posed by Antifa -- a far-left, sometimes violent collection of self-described anti-fascists -- thus priming viewers to perceive a movement that has been much less deadly than far-right extremism as a principal threat to the nation. But the problem here is bigger than any one media outlet. The lie about Antifa and the Capitol has been promoted by a large roster of right-wing people and entities. They include right-wing television networks Newsmax and One America News; Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Trump impeachment attorney Michael van der Veen; Republican members of Congress like Rep. Mo Brooks, Rep. Matt Gaetz and Sen. Ron Johnson; Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Republican state legislators; former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin; right-wing conspiracy websites like The Gateway Pundit; and popular right-wing commentators on social media and talk radio. The peddlers of the lie have found a tiny nugget of truth to help their cause. Of more than 260 Capitol defendants who have been revealed by the Department of Justice to date, one of them, John Sullivan, is a political oddball who has used the hashtag #antifa on social media. But left-wing activists have previously expressed suspicion about him, the FBI has never claimed that he is an actual Antifa activist and, regardless, the list of people charged over the riot is overwhelmingly composed of Trump supporters -- including, as Wray testified Tuesday, militia members and White supremacists. A history of blaming AntifaIn a well-reported story this week, The New York Times identified a false article published by the conservative Washington Times on the day of the insurrection as particularly impactful in the spread of the lie that Antifa was responsible. The article, which the Washington Times later corrected, wrongly claimed that a facial recognition company had identified two Antifa members at the Capitol. There's no doubt that the inaccurate version of the article went viral on social media. If it hadn't, though, some other Antifa-related lie almost certainly would have.Joan Donovan, research director at Harvard University's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, noted that right-wing media has found a way to falsely blame Antifa for everything from mass shootings to wildfires. The lie about Antifa orchestrating the Capitol attack, Donovan said, is part of ""a very long disinformation campaign against the left"" by a ""right-wing media ecosystem that wants to shift the blame for anything bad that happens in our society.""And much of the ecosystem of right-wing media consumers is willing to eat it up. As impossible as it seems to get Fox News and other lucrative right-wing platforms to behave more responsibly in supplying information, it seems just as hard to address the demand-side problem. Between the popularity of absurd lies about the birthplace of former President Barack Obama, the rise of the bonkers QAnon movement, the popularity of Trump's lies about the 2020 election and now the popularity of this lie about Antifa and the Capitol, it appears clear that millions of right-wing Americans are eager to believe in outlandish conspiracy theories about their political opponents.  Fact-checkers will keep debunking the nonsense. But we know that in the short term there is no number of fact checks or statements from the FBI that can convince millions of Americans that they are wrong."

Those contests will tee up Election Day on November 8, when control of the House and Senate will be up for grabs as well as several high-profile gubernatorial races in key battleground states.The outcome of November's elections will serve as a referendum on President Joe Biden's first two years in office and set the table for the 2024 presidential campaign. Biden and congressional Democrats have scored some legislative victories and are poised to confirm a history-making pick to the Supreme Court in Ketanji Brown Jackson. Yet economic anxiety punctuated by inflation concerns combined with exhaustion over the coronavirus pandemic has tilted the political environment in favor of Republicans, who also have electoral history on their side. There is also a unique dynamic to these midterms, with former President Donald Trump eyeing a potential return to the White House and looking to lay the groundwork by endorsing candidates in GOP primaries who have embraced his lies about the 2020 election results.The majority in the Senate, currently split 50-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as a tiebreaker, is expected to come down to a handful of competitive races. There are four Democratic incumbents running in battleground states Biden won in 2020: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and New Hampshire. Republicans have incumbents seeking reelection in Wisconsin and Florida, and they're defending three open seats in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Ohio. In total, 34 Senate seats will be decided in November.In the House, Republicans need a net gain of five seats to win control of the chamber. More than 40 members, mostly Democrats, have announced they are leaving Congress. Some of those decisions were driven by redistricting, the once-a-decade process of redrawing congressional and state legislative boundaries. In states with partisan control of the process, both parties have tried to draw new maps to their advantage: to pick up more seats, shore up incumbents or reduce the number of competitive districts.Read MoreThere are currently 27 Republican governors and 23 Democratic governors -- with 36 seats up for grabs this November -- including several in battleground states that could play a significant role in deciding the outcome of the 2024 election. Beyond elections for governor, state races for secretary of state and attorney general will receive unprecedented attention, as the battle over how elections are handled intensifies in the aftermath of the 2020 campaign.Here are the key dates and contests to watch as the 2022 primary process plays out:March 1: Texas primariesTexas Gov. Greg Abbott The Lone Star State is home to a few intriguing GOP statewide primaries and a House Democratic primary that highlights the ideological divide within the party.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is seeking reelection to a third term, which could set the stage for a potential 2024 bid. First, he must get through a GOP primary that includes challenges from former (Florida) Rep. Allen West and businessman and ex-state Sen. Don Huffines.There is also a contested Republican primary in the race for state attorney general, with incumbent Ken Paxton being challenged by state Land Commissioner George P. Bush, US Rep. Louie Gohmert and former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman. Paxton's rivals have taken aim at his legal problems, but Trump has thrown his support behind the incumbent, who led a failed effort to challenge the 2020 election results in four battleground states at the US Supreme Court.In south Texas, there is a rematch of a 2020 Democratic primary in the 28th Congressional District between centrist Rep. Henry Cuellar and immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros, who has received the endorsement of progressive leaders, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The FBI searched Cuellar's home and campaign office in January, but the nine-term congressman released a video a week later vowing to seek reelection despite the ""ongoing investigation.""The Dallas-area 3rd Congressional District is the site of a battle over how the GOP should handle the 2020 election and the events of January 6, 2021. Rep. Van Taylor is a conservative Republican, but he voted to accept the 2020 presidential election results and supported an independent commission to investigate the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. (He opposed the select committee that was eventually created.) He's now facing several primary challengers who question the results of the election, criticize Taylor's vote on the commission and downplay the Capitol insurrection. The district also became much more Republican in redistricting, so while the seat shouldn't be competitive in November, it could be easier for a more right-wing candidate to defeat Taylor in the primary. April 5: Special election primary in California's 22nd Congressional DistrictFormer GOP Rep. Devin NunesFormer GOP Rep. Devin Nunes set off this special primary contest with his resignation from Congress in January to join Trump's new social media venture. Assuming no candidate gets a majority of the vote in the all-party primary, the top two finishers will face off in June, when California holds its general election primaries, giving the eventual winner about six months to represent this Central Valley seat in Congress. The district will have new boundaries for the election held in November.May 3: Indiana and Ohio primariesOhio Gov. Mike DeWineThe Buckeye State has a pair of Republican primary battles that could offer early clues about the GOP electorate heading into the heart of the nominating calendar.Republican Gov. Mike DeWine is seeking a second term. His management of the coronavirus pandemic has become the target of fierce criticism from opponent Jim Renacci, a former GOP congressman who has accused DeWine of governing Ohio ""like a blue-state liberal."" On the Democratic side, it's a battle between two former mayors, with Dayton's Nan Whaley and Cincinnati's John Cranley squaring off for the nomination.In the GOP Senate primary, the crowded contest has at times veered toward political theater as several top contenders -- most notably former state Treasurer Josh Mandel and ""Hillbilly Elegy"" author J.D. Vance -- have sought to burnish their conservative pro-Trump credentials with incendiary rhetoric and inflammatory displays of opposition to public health precautions. Former state GOP chair Jane Timken and businessman Mike Gibbons are also making plays for the Trump base, while state Sen. Matt Dolan is testing the theory that there is still room in the party for a candidate who doesn't fully embrace the former President.After a history of teasing potential statewide bids only to pass, Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan decided to take the plunge (with a helpful shove from redistricting) and launched a bid for US Senate. He faces a primary challenge from consumer protection attorney Morgan Harper. While Ohio has been trending red in recent years, Ryan is hoping to follow a similar blue-collar blueprint that has helped Sen. Sherrod Brown win statewide three times, most recently against Renacci in 2018. May 10: Nebraska and West Virginia primariesWest Virginia Rep. David McKinleyWest Virginia is poised to hold the country's first incumbent vs. incumbent primary of the 2022 cycle, featuring GOP Reps. David McKinley and Alex Mooney. The Republicans were drawn into the new 2nd Congressional District after the state lost a House seat following the 2020 census. The matchup will be an early test of Trump's sway in GOP primaries, with the former President backing Mooney over McKinley, who did not object to counting the Electoral College vote and supported the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Mooney objected to the Pennsylvania electoral count, but not Arizona, and voted against the infrastructure package. In Nebraska, outgoing Gov. Pete Ricketts urged Trump to stay out of the GOP primary to replace him, but the former President spurned the request and threw his support behind businessman Charles Herbster last October. Ricketts later endorsed Nebraska University Regent Jim Pillen, setting up a proxy battle between the two GOP leaders who both carried the Cornhusker State by wide margins.Meanwhile, in Nebraska's 1st Congressional District, embattled GOP Rep. Jeff Fortenberry is facing a primary challenge from state Sen. Mike Flood, who has been endorsed by Ricketts and former Gov. Dave Heineman. Fortenberry was indicted last fall for allegedly concealing information and lying to federal authorities investigating illegal campaign contributions. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.May 17: Idaho, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oregon and Pennsylvania primariesCelebrity doctor Mehmet OzThe fight for the GOP Senate nomination in Pennsylvania could be one of the nastiest and most expensive primary contests of the entire 2022 cycle, with hedge fund executive David McCormick and celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz trading pointed attacks over their personal ties to foreign countries. Both contenders are pumping massive amounts of their personal wealth into TV ads. The crowded field also includes former US ambassador to Denmark Carla Sands, who, like the top contenders, is relying on her personal wealth, and Jeff Bartos, the party's 2018 nominee for lieutenant governor. The race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey was upended last November when Trump-backed candidate Sean Parnell ended his campaign amid scrutiny of his turbulent personal life. So far, the former President has held off on throwing his support behind another candidate, a move that could shake up the trajectory of the primary.Democrats see the Keystone State as perhaps the party's best opportunity to flip a Republican-held Senate seat. The competition on the Democratic side features candidates with distinct backgrounds who represent divergent ideological factions within the party. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, an outspoken progressive and strong fundraiser, and Rep. Conor Lamb, a Marine Corps veteran and former federal prosecutor, are seen as the top contenders. Rounding out the field is state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who has won the backing of some progressive groups.There is also a wide-open race for governor in Pennsylvania, with Democrat Tom Wolf term-limited. The lone Democratic candidate is state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who was one of the leading officials rebutting false claims about the commonwealth's 2020 election results. The GOP field includes state Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman, former US Rep. Lou Barletta, former US Attorney Bill McSwain, state Sen. Doug Mastriano and businessman Dave White. Trump, and his lies about the election, are expected to be a driving factor in the primary.In North Carolina, Trump's early surprise endorsement of US Rep. Ted Budd failed to clear the GOP Senate primary field, with former Gov. Pat McCrory, former US Rep. Mark Walker and Army veteran Marjorie K. Eastman also in the running to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Richard Burr. Walker announced in January he would stay in the Senate race, defying Trump's effort to get the former congressman to drop his bid and run for a House seat. On the Democratic side, the party has largely cleared the field for former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley.Idaho is another state home to a GOP civil war, with Gov. Brad Little getting a primary challenge from Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin. The two have engaged in a political tug-of-war, with McGeachin on multiple occasions using her powers as acting governor to issue executive orders while Little was out of state, only to have the governor rescind them upon his return. Trump endorsed McGeachin last November, calling her a ""a true supporter of MAGA from the very beginning.""May 24: Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia primaries; Texas runoffs (if necessary)Georgia Gov. Brian KempThere is perhaps no state on the 2022 map where Trump is seeking to exert his influence on the Republican Party more than Georgia, where he rolled out a ""Trump ticket"" of candidates, including two who are challenging GOP incumbents the former President attacked after they rejected his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.The top target for Trump is Gov. Brian Kemp, whose decision to certify Biden's narrow win in Georgia unleashed fierce and frequent attacks by the former President. The attacks culminated with Trump's endorsement of former US Sen. David Perdue after he launched a primary challenge against Kemp. Perdue lost his Senate runoff to Democrat Jon Ossoff in January 2021, which some Republicans blamed, in part, on Trump's efforts to undermine the state's election results. Now Perdue is making Trump's lies about the 2020 election a cornerstone of his bid to defeat Kemp. The winner of the GOP primary will likely face Democrat Stacey Abrams, who lost the 2018 gubernatorial race to Kemp by less than 2 percentage points.While the GOP primary for governor is unsettled, Republican Herschel Walker has plenty of running room in the Senate race. The former football star has Trump's support as he seeks to defeat Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who scored a 2-point victory in a Senate special election runoff against Republican Kelly Loeffler last year. Warnock has been a prolific fundraiser, beginning 2022 with nearly $23 million in the bank.Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger stood up to Trump's demands that he ""find"" the votes to overturn the 2020 election results in the state. Now the question is whether the state's top election official can withstand a primary challenge from Trump-backed US Rep. Jody Hice, who embraced the former President's false claims about the election. Among the Democratic contenders are state Rep. Bee Nguyen, who succeeded Abrams in the state legislature, and former Fulton County Commission chair John Eaves.The Atlanta area will host the year's first Democratic member vs. member primary, with Reps. Lucy McBath and Carolyn Bourdeaux running in the newly redrawn 7th Congressional District after the GOP-controlled state legislature turned McBath's current seat safely red. Both Democrats flipped suburban districts previously held by Republicans -- McBath in 2018 and Bourdeaux in 2020. Georgia won't be the only state testing the power of Trump's endorsement on this primary day. In Alabama, US Rep. Mo Brooks is hoping the former President's support will help deliver him the GOP Senate nomination. But the conservative firebrand is running against two well-funded opponents: Katie Britt, a former top aide to retiring Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, and Mike Durant, an aerospace executive and former Blackhawk helicopter pilot. Brooks has struggled to take command of the field, prompting frustration from the former President.Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey is running for a second full term but is being challenged by several candidates in the GOP primary, including Lindy Blanchard, who served as ambassador to Slovenia in the Trump administration. Blanchard initially launched a bid for the open Senate seat but switched gears to run for governor last December.In Arkansas, Sarah Huckabee Sanders -- a former White House press secretary under Trump and daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee -- has a clear path to the Republican nomination as she seeks to succeed GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson. With Trump having carried the Natural State by more than 20 points in 2020, Sanders is poised to follow in her father's footsteps and become Arkansas' first female governor.June 7: California, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota primaries; special election in California's 22nd Congressional District (if necessary)California Gov. Gavin NewsomLast September, California Gov. Gavin Newsom became the second governor in US history to defeat a recall. Now the Democrat appears to be coasting toward a second term in office -- which could serve as a platform for a national run down the road. There are already signs of a brewing feud between Newsom and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a top GOP 2024 prospect.Sen. Alex Padilla, appointed by Newsom to the seat vacated by Harris ahead of her becoming vice president, is running for a full six-year term. At the same time, Padilla must run in a special election for the remaining weeks of the original Harris term. California is losing a US House seat for the first time in the state's history because of slower population growth. The new congressional maps, drawn by an independent commission, have scrambled the Golden State's political landscape. With the potential for as many as 10 competitive House races this fall, the state's top-two primary system could be a major factor in shaping the battleground map.GOP Rep. David Valadao is running in the newly drawn 22nd District in the Central Valley, which became more favorable to Democrats under redistricting. Valadao is the only House Republican running for reelection who voted for to impeach Trump in 2021 for inciting the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol and doesn't have a challenger endorsed by the former President (yet). Among his Democratic challengers is Rudy Salas, a California assemblyman and former member of the Bakersfield City Council. Another race to keep an eye on is the new 27th District around Los Angeles, where GOP Rep. Mike Garcia is a top target of Democrats. His challengers include former state assemblywoman Christy Smith, who is running for a third time against Garcia. She lost a special election and general election to him in 2020, with the latter race decided by a margin of just 333 votes. Democrat Quaye Quartey, a retired Navy intelligence officer, is also running.Prior to serving as Trump's interior secretary, Ryan Zinke spent about two years representing Montana in the US House. Zinke is now eyeing a return to Capitol Hill after Montana gained a House seat following the 2020 census, though he's facing scrutiny about his current ties to the state. June 14: Maine, Nevada, North Dakota and South Carolina primariesNevada Sen. Catherine Cortez MastoNevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is one of the most endangered Senate Democrats running this year, looking to carry a state Biden won by less than 3 points in 2020. The top contender in the GOP field is former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, the party's 2018 nominee for governor, who has managed to unite the Trump and Mitch McConnell wings. Still, he is facing a primary challenge from Army veteran Sam Brown, who has demonstrated some fundraising strength.In the Silver State's race for governor, incumbent Democrat Steve Sisolak is seeking a second term, with several Republicans lining up to run against him, including former US Sen. Dean Heller and Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo.The fate of two Trump targets could be decided this day in South Carolina, where the former President has endorsed primary challengers to GOP Reps. Tom Rice and Nancy Mace. In the 7th Congressional District, Trump has backed state Rep. Russell Fry against Rice, who was one of the 10 House Republicans to vote in favor of Trump's impeachment last January. Mace, who represents the 1st District, voted to certify the election results (but not for impeachment) and has tried to walk the Trump tightrope, criticizing his actions at times and embracing the former President at others. Trump has thrown his support behind former state Rep. Katie Arrington, who defeated former Rep. Mark Sanford in the 2018 GOP primary for the 1st District, only to lose to Democrat Joe Cunningham in the general election.In Maine, a pair of Republicans are attempting political comebacks -- with former Gov. Paul LePage and former US Rep. Bruce Poliquin both running for their old jobs. LePage is looking to challenge Democrat Janet Mills, who won the 2018 race to succeed him. Poliquin is eyeing a rematch in the 2nd Congressional District with Jared Golden, the Democrat who defeated him four years ago. June 21: DC and Virginia primaries; runoffs in Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia (if necessary)Virginia Rep. Abigail SpanbergerLast November's victory by Republican Glenn Youngkin in the race for Virginia governor boosted the GOP's hopes that 2022 would be a strong year for the party in the commonwealth and beyond. This year, the battleground in the Old Dominion will center on two competitive House races featuring a pair of Democrats first elected in the 2018 blue wave -- Reps. Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria. A handful Republicans have lined up to challenge Spanberger in the new 7th Congressional District, which was redrawn to include more of the Democratic-leaning exurbs in Northern Virginia but no longer includes the congresswoman's home near Richmond. Luria's 2nd District, meanwhile, became more favorable to Republicans under redistricting, with state Sen. Jen Kiggans seen as a top contender in the GOP primary.June 28: Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Oklahoma and Utah primaries; runoffs in Mississippi and South Carolina (if necessary)Illinois Rep. Mary MillerThe Land of Lincoln is the scene of not one but two dual incumbent House primaries after Illinois lost a seat based on the 2020 census.The GOP contest in the 15th District will provide another test of Trump's endorsement strength, with Reps. Mary Miller and Rodney Davis facing off. The former President rebuffed the advice of GOP leaders to remain neutral and threw his support behind Miller, a freshman member who has stirred controversy since arriving in Congress. Davis, now in his fifth term, is an ally of House Republican leadership and poised to become a committee chairman if the GOP wins control of the chamber.Democrats have their own incumbent vs. incumbent primary in the 6th District, where Reps. Sean Casten and Marie Newman will compete for the party's nomination. Casten flipped a GOP-held seat in 2018 while Newman narrowly defeated conservative Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski in a 2020 primary before winning her general election race by double digits.On the same day, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul will face off against US Rep. Tom Suozzi and New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams in the Democratic primary as Hochul seeks a full term in office. Hochul became the first female governor of the Empire State last August after Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned amid allegations of sexual harassment. Among the candidates on the Republican side are Rep. Lee Zeldin, 2014 GOP gubernatorial nominee Rob Astorino, businessman Harry Wilson and Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. With popular Republican Gov. Larry Hogan unable to run for a third term in Maryland, Democrats are hopeful about their prospects of retaking the governor's mansion after eight years of Republican rule. That optimism has produced a crowded Democratic field, which includes former US Labor Secretary Tom Perez, state Comptroller Peter Franchot, author and former nonprofit chief Wes Moore and former US Education Secretary John King. Trump has endorsed state Del. Daniel Cox, who is running in the GOP primary against Hogan's preferred candidate, state Commerce Secretary Kelly Schulz.July 26: North Carolina runoffs (if necessary)The calendar in July is rather bare, unless any of the North Carolina primary contests in May require a runoff to decide the winner. Candidates only need to top 30% of the vote to avoid that scenario.August 2: Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington primariesArizona Secretary of State Katie HobbsTwo states at the center of Trump's lies about the 2020 election will vote on this day -- Arizona and Michigan.Sparked by the former President's falsehoods, GOP lawmakers in Arizona launched a months-long partisan review of the results in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, which ultimately confirmed Biden's victory there. That fact has failed to dissuade Republican candidates from embracing Trump's baseless claims. The former President has endorsed former TV anchor Kari Lake, who is running for governor, and state Rep. Mark Finchem, a candidate for secretary of state, both of whom have cast doubts about the 2020 election results. Current Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, is running for governor, putting her defense of the state's elections at the center of her candidacy. In addition to Lake, the other Republican contenders include former US Rep. Matt Salmon, developer and former Arizona Board of Regents member Karrin Taylor Robson and businessman Steve Gaynor.Finchem is joined in the GOP secretary of state primary by state Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, who has advocated for so-called election integrity legislation. The Democratic candidates hoping to succeed Hobbs include Adrian Fontes, the former Maricopa County recorder, and Arizona House Minority Leader Reginald Bolding.Trump has yet to endorse in the Arizona GOP Senate primary, but his impact on the field has been felt in how the leading candidates are positioning themselves to align with the former President's policies and politics. That list of hopefuls includes state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, businessman Jim Lamon and venture capitalist Blake Masters, who has the backing of tech billionaire Peter Thiel and the anti-tax Club for Growth. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly and his massive campaign war chest await whichever candidate emerges victorious on the Republican side. The former astronaut is running for a full six-year term after defeating appointed Republican Sen. Martha McSally in a 2020 special election. In Michigan, Trump has endorsed two statewide candidates who've spread election falsehoods -- Kristina Karamo for secretary of state and Matthew DePerno for state attorney general. They are seeking to challenge incumbent Democrats Jocelyn Benson and Dana Nessel, who have pushed back on Trump's efforts to undermine the state's 2020 election results.Michigan Gov. Gretchen WhitmerDemocratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who was on Biden's short list for vice president, is also seeking a second term. Businessman Kevin Rinke and former Detroit police chief James Craig are among a packed field of GOP candidates looking to challenge Whitmer.The new congressional map in Michigan has set up an all-incumbent primary battle in the 11th district featuring Democratic Reps. Haley Stevens and Andy Levin. The district's new lines make it a safer seat for Democrats than the one Stevens flipped in 2018. Levin has deep political roots in the state, with his father, Sander, serving in the US House for more than 30 years and his uncle Carl Levin serving six terms as a US senator.GOP Rep. Peter Meijer is running for reelection in Michigan's 3rd Congressional District after voting for impeachment and faces a primary challenge in John Gibbs, a former Trump administration official who has the backing of the former President. Trump has also endorsed state Rep. Steve Carra, who had launched a bid against Rep. Fred Upton, another GOP member who voted to impeach. But Upton has not yet officially announced if he's running for another term, which would mean having to face off against fellow GOP Rep. Bill Huizenga in the newly drawn 4th District.Two House Republicans from Washington who voted for Trump's impeachment -- Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse -- will also face GOP primary voters on this day. Both have Trump-backed opponents in their all-party primaries. Retired Army Special Forces officer Joe Kent is challenging Beutler, while failed 2020 gubernatorial candidate Loren Culp is seeking to oust Newhouse. Like in California, the top two finishers in the primary advance to the general election, regardless of party affiliation.In Missouri, there is a crowded GOP primary to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Roy Blunt in a state that should favor the party. Some Republicans are concerned that if former Gov. Eric Greitens emerges as the nominee, it could put the seat in play for Democrats, given his scandal-plagued past. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley has endorsed US Rep. Vicky Hartzler in the primary, with state Attorney General Eric Schmitt, US Rep. Billy Long, state Senate President Pro Tempore Dave Schatz and St. Louis attorney Mark McCloskey also in the mix. On the Democratic side, Marine veteran Lucas Kunce appears to be the leading contender.August 4: Tennessee primariesFormer State Department spokesperson Morgan OrtagusTennessee Republicans cracked Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper's Nashville-based seat in redistricting, diluting the power of the vote in Davidson County, spreading it across three GOP-leaning districts. The move prompted Cooper to announce his retirement. It has also sparked a GOP showdown for the new 5th Congressional District. Trump is backing Morgan Ortagus, a former State Department spokesperson, while two top allies of the former President -- US Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Madison Cawthorn -- are supporting social media influencer Robby Starbuck. Former state House Speaker Beth Harwell is running for the redrawn seat as well. August 9: Connecticut, Minnesota, Vermont and Wisconsin primariesWisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson is the only Republican senator seeking reelection in a state Biden carried in 2020. A dozen Democrats have lined up to take on the two-term incumbent, who has evolved from a tea party insurgent during his first run in 2010 to a promoter of Covid-19 and January 6 conspiracies. The leading Democratic challengers appear to be Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry and state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski.The GOP field to take on Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is less crowded, with former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, state Rep. Timothy Ramthun and Kevin Nicholson, who lost in the 2018 Senate Republican primary, among the contenders. The last time a Republican candidate won a statewide office in Minnesota was 2006, when former Gov. Tim Pawlenty was narrowly reelected. Several Republicans are running to prevent Democratic Gov. Tim Walz from winning a second term. Misinformation about Covid-19 and the 2020 election have been key issues in the GOP primary. One leading candidate is Scott Jensen, a former state senator and family doctor, who has voiced vaccine skepticism and opposition to mandates. Another physician, Neil Shah, has suggested he took an unproven drug to treat coronavirus. At a forum last December, none of the five candidates who participated were willing to answer a plain ""yes"" when asked whether they thought Biden won a ""constitutional majority in the Electoral College.""Ultimately, whether Republicans lean toward a candidate like Jensen or Shah or a more mainstream pick like state Sens. Paul Gazelka or Michelle Benson, the primary may well be decided long before August. The state GOP will endorse a candidate at its convention in May and most, if not all, of the other candidates could drop their bids if they don't earn that nod.Vermont is the only state in the union that's never sent a woman to Congress. But Democratic Sen. Pat Leahy's decision to call it quits after almost 50 years in the Senate started a domino effect that could change that. Democratic Rep. Peter Welch, the state's lone House member, is trying to move across the Capitol to succeed Leahy. That's set up a Democratic primary in which two of the leading candidates are women. Lt. Gov. Molly Gray and state Sen. Becca Balint both declared for the seat shortly after Welch made his announcement.Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican who leads one of the most Democratic states in the nation, will also be up for reelection (Vermont governors serve two-year terms) but he's yet to announce his plans.Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, both Democrats, also face voters this year. August 13: Hawaii primariesHawaii Lt. Gov. Josh GreenTerm limits prevent Hawaii Gov. David Ige from seeking a third term, and several Democrats have lined up to succeed him. The primary field includes Lt. Gov. Josh Green, a doctor who has been one of the main faces of the state's pandemic response, former Hawaii first lady Vicky Cayetano and former Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell. US Rep. Kai Kahele has also been mentioned as a potential candidate. Hawaii is one of the most Democratic states in the country, so the winner of the Democratic primary will be heavily favored in November. August 16: Alaska and Wyoming primaries; South Dakota runoffs (if necessary) Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney Two of Trump's top GOP targets in 2022 are Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. The coincidence of both states holding primaries on the same day sets up an epic test of the former President's sway in the GOP. There is arguably no Republican who has drawn Trump's ire more than Cheney, who voted in favor of impeachment last year and is the vice chair on the House select committee investigating the events surrounding the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Trump has endorsed Harriet Hageman, a onetime critic, as the candidate to fulfill his goal of ousting Cheney. So has House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. And the Republican National Committee took the unprecedented step of censuring the congreswoman. Working in Cheney's favor are her family's deep roots in the state and her massive campaign war chest. She also might benefit from the fact that she could win the primary without receiving a majority of the vote, as Hageman has not cleared the field of Cheney challengers despite Trump's support.Murkowski is the lone Republican running for reelection this year who voted to convict Trump at his impeachment trial in the Senate. The former President has backed Kelly Tshibaka, who formerly led Alaska's Department of Administration. But the race in Alaska will be complicated by the state's new election system, with all the Senate candidates running on a single ballot and the top four finishers, regardless of party, advancing to the general election, which will be decided by ranked-choice voting. Given that, Murkowski is almost certain to advance to the November vote, where she could benefit from the reallocation process. The senator has faced tough reelection campaigns before -- winning as a write-in candidate in 2010 after losing the GOP primary to a tea party challenger. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and his allies are firmly behind Murkowski's bid.August 23: Florida primaries; Oklahoma runoffs (if necessary)Florida Gov. Ron DeSantisFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, who has made himself a national figure with a laissez-faire approach to the Covid-19 pandemic and willingness to embrace hot-button conservative causes, might be eyeing another office in a few years. But first, he needs to win a second term, with the possibility of a decisive victory likely to only spark further speculation about his ambitions beyond the Sunshine State.Three Democrats are hoping to derail DeSantis' rise, with US Rep. Charlie Crist, a former Republican governor, trying to reclaim his seat as Florida's chief executive. Crist leads the Democratic field in fundraising. The other contenders to take on DeSantis are state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried and state Sen. Annette Taddeo.Before DeSantis, Sen. Marco Rubio was seen as the GOP's rising star in Florida. His failed 2016 presidential bid upended that trajectory and led Rubio to reverse course and seek reelection to the Senate. Now he's seeking a third term, with the onetime tea party darling turned Trump critic having fully embraced the former President amid Florida's shift to the right. US Rep. Val Demings, a former Orlando police chief, is the prohibitive favorite in the Democratic primary and has been a strong fundraiser.The outcome of these two races could dictate heading into 2024 how much attention and resources Democrats will deploy to Florida, which has been one of the premier battleground states in presidential races for many cycles. September 6: Massachusetts primariesFormer state Rep. Geoff DiehlThe decision by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker to not seek a third term in deep-blue Massachusetts sets up another test of Trump's power inside the GOP. Former state Rep. Geoff Diehl originally launched his campaign as a challenge to Baker and picked up Trump's endorsement. But while Diehl won't have the popular incumbent as an opponent, he also doesn't have a clear lane to November. Chris Doughty, a businessman and self-described moderate, joined the race in late January. While he doesn't have electoral experience like Diehl, Doughty was able to open his campaign with half a million dollars of his own money.  On the Democratic side, state Attorney General Maura Healey, who entered the race after Baker declined to run again, leads the entire field in fundraising. State Sen. Sonia Chang-Díaz is also running. Despite favoring Democrats at the federal level, Massachusetts has a habit of electing moderate Republican governors. Without Baker on the ballot, Democrats are hopeful they'll avoid such a fate this November. September 13: Delaware, New Hampshire and Rhode Island primariesNew Hampshire Sen. Maggie HassanDemocratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire is one of the GOP's top targets in 2022, but the party's hopes of flipping the seat took a hit last November when popular Granite State Gov. Chris Sununu passed on a Senate bid. Sununu's decision sets up what could be a long and crowded GOP primary, given New Hampshire's late primary date. Candidates include former Londonderry Town Manager Kevin Smith, retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc and state Senate President Chuck Morse, who's received praise from McConnell. Redistricting is poised to make New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District, currently held by Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas, more favorable for Republicans. That shift has attracted a wide field of GOP challengers, including Matt Mowers, who lost to Pappas in 2020, former Trump aide Karoline Leavitt and Gail Huff Brown, a former TV anchor and the wife of former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown.There will likely be another crowded primary on this day on the Democratic side in the Rhode Island governor's race. Then-Lt. Gov. Dan McKee was elevated to the top job when Gina Raimondo was appointed as Biden's commerce secretary last year, and he's now seeking a full term. But Rhode Island Democrats aren't just letting McKee have it. The packed field currently includes Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, former Secretary of State Matt Brown and Helena Foulkes, a former executive at Rhode Island-based CVS.

And after moving toward Democrats in the 2018 and 2020 elections largely because of their distaste for Donald Trump, independents are now giving Biden job ratings in both state and national polls nearly as low as they ever provided Trump.Independents ""swung heavily against Republicans in 2018 and 2020 because they hated Donald Trump,"" says Dick Wadhams, the former Republican state chair in Colorado. ""Now these same unaffiliated voters are looking at the guy in the White House, Democrats in Congress, Democrats in the state legislatures, and I don't think they like what they see.""After the frequent promises of ""transformative"" leadership during his first year, Biden's more meat-and-potatoes State of the Union address -- with its emphasis on such centrist themes as funding, rather than ""defunding,"" the police -- struck many analysts in both parties as a reset with those less partisan voters. Some national polling and other analysis since the speech suggest that the address, along with Biden's visibility leading the Western response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, may, in fact, be generating a second look for him among some of them. Is this the beginning of a Joe Biden comeback?During the speech, ""there were a variety of places where Democrats, independents and Republicans were traveling together in their responses in a way that is really heartening"" for Biden, says Democratic pollster Margie Omero, who observed the reactions of a ""dial group"" of voters to the remarks.Read MoreStill, most strategists in both parties agree it will take time, and sustained real world gains on inflation and the pandemic, for Biden to climb out of the hole he's fallen into with independents, especially because so many of them say in recent polls that they do not consider him a strong leader. While Biden still has time to recover among them by 2024, Republican pollster Glen Bolger says the President faces much longer odds of a significant rebound before November's midterm elections. Over that time frame, Bolger argues, ""it's hard for independents to move from where they are to even a mixed rating of the guy."" Given the tightening correlation between voter attitudes about the president and their choices in House and Senate races, that's a daunting prospect for Democrats. Their best chance of avoiding a wipeout among independents this fall may revolve less around improving their view of Biden than rekindling their doubts about Republicans -- particularly their ties to Trump. Exactly how many voters qualify as true independents unaffiliated with either party is a matter of sustained dispute. In Gallup polling, about 4 in 10, and often more, adults have identified as independents since early in Barack Obama's presidency. In the Edison Research exit polls conducted for a consortium of media organizations, the share of voters who identify as independents has varied only between 25% and 30% in every election in this century.But party operatives and political scientists agree that most of those independents are, as the saying goes, partisans who just don't want to wear their team's jerseys. After sorting out the self-described independents who lean reliably toward either side, Gallup consistently records a little more than 1 in 10 adults as fully independent. The Cooperative Election Study, a large-scale survey conducted by an academic consortium, likewise characterizes about 7% to 10% of voters as truly independent from both parties. Others put the number slightly higher: CNN polling director Jennifer Agiesta says the network's latest national survey identified about 1 in 6 Americans as truly unaffiliated with either side. Who are independent voters?Independents don't entirely fit any one demographic or ideological profile: They include both well-educated voters who are socially liberal and fiscally conservative (probably the dominant image) as well as plenty of non-college voters who are the opposite. In fact, the composition of who identifies as an independent changes from election to election as events nudge voters in and out of allegiance to the two major parties: The share of self-identified independents, for instance, who called themselves conservative was much higher in the 2010 GOP landslide than in the sweeping 2018 Democratic midterm gains, according to exit poll data provided to CNN by Edison. The voters who identified as independent in 2018 were also younger and much better educated than in 2010.Compared with a generation ago, almost all campaigns in both parties have reduced their focus on persuading independents or swing voters and shifted more toward mobilizing their base supporters. But somewhat paradoxically, because each side has done so well at turning out its base, support from independents still often constitutes the tipping point in states or House districts closely balanced between the two sides. ""Even though deepening partisanship has reduced the number of swing voters, the narrow margins of our recent national elections has made these voters more important than ever,"" the veteran Democratic analysts William Galston and Elaine Kamarck wrote in a recent paper for the centrist Progressive Policy Institute. ""This reality will dominate national politics until one party breaks the deadlock of the past three decades and creates a decisive national majority.""Exit polls of House elections over the past four decades provide one measure of that tipping-point role. The party that won more independents in the exit polls also won the national House popular vote in every election since 1986, with the sole exception of 2004, when House Republicans narrowly lost independents but still won more votes nationally because of the surge in GOP turnout that President George W. Bush engineered that year. The winning party carried independents by double-digit margins in each recent year with a big congressional swing: the major Democratic gains in 2006 and 2018 and the Republican sweeps in 1994, 2010 and 2014, exit polls found. It's likely the case that some true independents are always voting for the lesser of two evils, so it's not unusual for independents to be dissatisfied with the president they have voted for in the past election. The fact that they are true independents means they don't like either party much anyway.Brian Schaffner, Tufts University political scientistThat's the foreboding backdrop for Democrats assessing a flurry of new state and national polls showing Biden facing a huge decline among the broadly defined group of independent voters (which includes those who lean toward either party). In 2020, the exit polls showed Biden carrying 54% of independents and beating Trump among them by 13 percentage points; the Pew Research Center's validated voters survey found only a slightly narrower margin for Biden. He roughly matched that vote with a 51% approval rating among independent adults in an April 2021 CNN poll, his high point among them in office.But the latest CNN national poll, conducted by SRSS, put Biden's overall job approval rating among independents at just 36%, with 64% disapproving. The most recent national surveys by Gallup, CBS and Fox also put his rating with them around that level; pre-State of the Union polls by ABC/Washington Post and NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist were even worse, with each showing only around 3 in 10 independents approving. A post-State of the Union Marist poll showed his approval with those voters improving to nearly 4 in 10, but that still left about 6 in 10 of them disapproving.By historic standards, these are very low numbers with independents. In CNN polling, Biden's standing with independents is only slightly above the lowest job approval the survey ever recorded among them for Trump (31%) or Obama (32%), according to Agiesta. Biden's standing with independents in the Gallup survey matches Obama's low point, though it still exceeds the nadir for Trump (30%) or George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, each of whom fell into the twenties at points.State polls tell the same story. The 2020 exit polls found Biden winning 53% or 54% of independent voters in two key swing states he carried -- Georgia and Wisconsin -- and more than 60% of them in a third, New Hampshire. But the most recent public state surveys in Georgia, New Hampshire and Wisconsin each put his current approval with independents at only around 1 in 3 or less.Biden is also scuffling with independents on other measures. In the latest CNN survey, just 33% of independent adults said his first year had been a success. Only 3 in 10 gave him good grades for handling the economy and just a little more than a third rated him positively on responding to crime. In the ABC/Washington Post poll, only 3 in 10 independents called him a strong leader; that number was only about 1 in 4 in the Fox survey. Why did this happen?Strategists in both parties generally agree that the same three dynamics have ground down Biden's standing with independents, though they differ on the relative emphasis they place on each.• One is ideological backlash. ""I keep coming back to the idea that he ran as a centrist and he's governed as a progressive and he's betrayed the electorate, particularly in Arizona,"" says Charles Coughlin, a Republican public relations and political consultant in the state.• The second is doubts about Biden's personal capacity for the job, measured in those recent surveys showing that roughly three-fifths of independents say they do not consider him a strong leader. • To both parties, though, probably the key driver of his decline is dissatisfaction with the country's overall direction, particularly on inflation, the lingering disruptions created by the coronavirus and, particularly in larger cities, crime and homelessness. Yair Ghitza, the chief scientist at Catalist, a prominent Democratic targeting firm, expressed an opinion common in both parties when he told me that views among independents change more based on current conditions in the country than do opinions among more hard-core partisans. ""Most of the time you are going to see independents moving more than the strong partisans,"" he says.JUST WATCHEDHear CNN political director's takeaways from post-SOTU pollReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHear CNN political director's takeaways from post-SOTU poll 03:26Brian Schaffner, a Tufts University political scientist who's a co-director of the Cooperative Election Study, agrees that voters not fully attached to either party typically respond more than partisans to shifts in current events. In the November 2021 Cooperative Election Study annual survey, Biden's approval rating among the voters the poll characterizes as true independents plummeted to just 25%. While that's an extremely low number, Schaffner points out that only rarely did more than 40% of these true independents approve of either Obama or Trump. ""It's likely the case that some true independents are always voting for the lesser of two evils, so it's not unusual for independents to be dissatisfied with the president they have voted for in the past election,"" he says. ""The fact that they are true independents means they don't like either party much anyway.""While Republicans have been outraged and Democrats frustrated and demoralized by the big ideological congressional battles that have derailed Biden's ""Build Back Better"" economic plan, many independents have seen the entire struggle as disconnected from their most pressing concerns, many analysts agree. ""They are not so ideologically"" engaged, says Coughlin. Instead their view is, ""I want to see it work. I want to see the border work; I want to see our country be strong again. I want to see the economy work; I want to see inflation go down.""These attitudes are translating into scary early numbers among independents for Democrats in several polls. In the ABC/Washington Post survey, independents gave Republicans a 14-percentage-point lead when asked which party they intended to support in November's election. For perspective, that's roughly the level of advantage among independents in the exit polls that Republicans amassed during their 1994 House landslide and slightly bigger than the Democratic lead in 2018.Can Democrats turn things around?Can Democrats dig out of this hole by November? Andrew Baumann, a Democratic pollster based in Colorado, a state with a large number of independent voters, sees three big imperatives for the party among them.• One is for Biden to regain at least some of the ground he's lost. ""He's not probably going to get back to 50 with this group by November,"" Baumann says, ""but there is a big difference between 35% and 45."" Most Democrats agree the key for any Biden revival with independents will be actual improvement in inflation and the virus. But many also believe that the chastened tone of his State of the Union address -- which replaced the promises of ""transformational"" leadership with more centrist language and reframed his economic plan as an effort to help families meet daily costs for child care, drugs and utilities -- was a step in the right direction. • Baumann's second priority is for candidates to emphasize their own strengths and establish separation from Biden where necessary. That's become harder to do, he acknowledges, in an era when attitudes toward the president increasingly shape voters' choices in House and Senate races. But polls suggest voters are still open to some differentiation: In a January Quinnipiac poll, for instance, the positive ratings among independents for Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, one of the key GOP targets in November's election, stood 15 points higher than Biden's.• Like many Democrats, though, Baumann thinks the key to Democrats' closing the gap with independents is to highlight the elements of the GOP's agenda they dislike. ""You need to just make it clear that even if these voters are not happy with Biden that the alternative here is unacceptable,"" he says. Democrats have no shortage of targets for that effort, party strategists believe. For instance, even as the GOP majority on the Supreme Court nears a decision that could overturn Roe v. Wade and Republican-controlled states race to impose new limits (or effective bans) on abortion, a January CNN poll found that nearly three-fourths of independents want to maintain the constitutional right to the procedure. Omero says Biden's defense of abortion rights in last week's speech was one of the moments when the positive reaction among independents veered most sharply from the negative response among Republicans.When the president is suffering from low approval ratings, it's common for his party to insist it will make the next election a choice, not a referendum. In practice, with views about the president exerting ever more influence over the results, that's become more and more difficult to do. Schaffner, like other analysts, believes that while raising doubts about the Republican alternative may help Democrats win back independents disillusioned with Biden in the 2024 presidential election, history suggests that contrast message does not work as well in a midterm. Independents, he says, ""because they don't like either party"" often engage in ""balancing behavior"" during midterms, which this year could translate into a view that ""I should vote Republican to cancel out my dislike of Biden.""But the continued polarization around Trump may offer Democrats an opportunity to break that pattern. For one thing, he remains about as unpopular among independents as Biden is. For another, he remains unusually visible, pressing his unfounded claims of fraud in the 2020 election, touting his admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin amid the Ukraine invasion and confronting continued revelations about his campaign to overturn the election's result, which culminated in the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol last year.

Democrats lost the 2016 presidential election, and they barely won in 2020. Part of their problem was declining support among White voters.But the 2020 election also pointed to another problem: Hispanic voters (who are growing as a portion of the electorate) moving toward the Republican Party. Recent polling -- and now this week's Texas primaries -- show that these Republican gains don't seem to be going away anytime soon.Texas is a heavily Hispanic state relative to the country as a whole. There are 16 counties in Texas where Hispanics make up at least 80% of the citizen voting age population, according to the latest data available from Census Bureau. The county with the highest percentage of Hispanic adult citizens (Starr County) backed now-President Joe Biden by 5 points in 2020, after voting for Hillary Clinton by 60 points four years earlier. (That's not a misprint. It really was a 55-point swing.)Regularly scheduled primaries, of course, don't feature a Democratic candidate versus a Republican candidate. We can, however, look at the relative turnout between the Democratic and Republican primaries. This is instructive in Texas where voters don't register by party and can choose which party's primary to vote in.Democrats look to win back Latino voters after Trump's inroads in South TexasAll told, 27% of the Texans who voted Tuesday in the 16 most Hispanic counties cast a ballot in the Republican primary. This may not seem like a lot but consider that in 2018, just 15% of those who voted in either the Democratic or Republican primary cast a ballot on the Republican side.Read MoreIn Starr County, 24% of primary votes were cast on the Republican side Tuesday. It was basically nothing in 2018, with a mere 0.2% of primary votes being cast on the Republican side. That's a 24-point shift.Compare this with what happened statewide in Texas this year. There was slight movement toward Republicans: Of the votes cast on the Democratic or Republican side, 65% were Republican primary votes. In 2018, it was 60%. This was a 4-point shift without rounding.Put another way, the shift in Republican primary participation in those 16 heavily Hispanic counties was nearly three times the statewide shift.More signs of a shiftTexas, though, is only one state. Further, it's just a primary.But even on the national level, Texas does not seem to be that much of an outlier.While it's not clear that Hispanic Americans have moved even more toward the Republicans relative to how Americans overall are shifting, it's clear that Republicans are holding their gains from 2020.Trump made big in-roads in Hispanic areas across the nationNationally, the three polls that meet CNN standards for reporting (CNN/SSRS, Fox and Quinnipiac University) have produced generic congressional ballot results since the beginning of the year and provided a crosstab on Hispanic voters' midterm preferences. The generic ballot asks respondents some form of the following question: ""If the elections for Congress were held today, would you vote for the Democratic or Republican Party?""Democrats have held a 23-point advantage among Hispanics on the generic congressional ballot in the average of these polls so far this year.An average of three estimates of how Americans voted in House races in 2020 (Catalist, the CNN exit poll and the Pew Research Center) found that Democrats won the House vote by about 28 points in 2020 among Hispanics.This 5-point shift toward Republicans among Hispanics is in line with the 5-point shift we see among voters overall -- Republicans ahead by 2 points on the generic congressional ballot, compared with losing the national House vote by 3 points in 2020.The key thing to realize, though, is that Democrats did worse -- and Republicans did better -- among Hispanic voters in 2020 House races relative to the national vote than in any House election since 2004. So while not losing additional ground is not a bad thing for Democrats, it's not a good thing either.The Biden factorIf anything, the picture gets better for Republicans when you examine Biden's popularity. Across the CNN, Fox and Quinnipiac polls this year, the President's net approval rating averages +2 points with Hispanic Americans. That's 17 points better than his net approval rating with voters overall in these polls (-15 points).CNN Poll: Most Biden detractors say he's done nothing they like since becoming presidentIn the 2020 election, Biden's margin with Hispanic voters was about 23 points better than it was overall.So compared with 2020, Biden is doing worse with Hispanics relative to how he is doing with voters overall. That's notable given that earlier in his presidency, Biden was doing significantly better among Hispanics relative to how he was doing overall and compared with how he did in 2020.This fits with an analysis from FiveThirtyEight's Geoffrey Skelley, which found that Biden's approval rating had fallen disproportionately among Hispanics over the course of his presidency.The fact that the political preferences of Hispanic Americans are jumping around may get at something larger: Their votes are up for grabs more so than the average voter's. While they may still be more Democratic-leaning, both parties have a good chance of making up ground among the Hispanic electorate.I'd expect a lot of attention to be focused on this growing bloc of voters in the midterms."

Rick Scott over the latter's 11-point plan to ""rescue"" America if Republicans win majorities in Congress this fall.Now, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson has caused a stir by suggesting -- and then un-suggesting -- that Republicans would work to repeal the Affordable Care Act if they retake power in Washington. ""For example, if we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare — I still think we need to fix our health-care system — we need to have the plan ahead of time so that once we get in office, we can implement it immediately, not knock around like we did last time and fail,"" Johnson said during a Breitbart News Radio interview Monday morning first flagged by The Washington Post.That would be a very big deal! After all, congressional Republicans spent the better part of the last decade -- legislatively and legally -- trying to dismantle the ACA. They repeatedly failed in that effort. And despite a rocky start to the health care program -- the failure of the initial website to sign up for coverage being the most obvious example -- the public has warmed to the law, which is colloquially known as Obamacare. In an October 2021 Kaiser Family Foundation poll, almost 6 in 10 (58%) of Americans said they had a favorable view of the law, while just 41% viewed it unfavorably.Read MoreTaking the ACA away -- or even talking about taking it away -- then is politically unwise.Which may explain why Johnson, who faces re-election this year, released a statement Monday night, um, clarifying his position.

""During a radio interview I used our failure to repeal and replace Obamacare as an example of how we need to be prepared to deliver on whatever agenda items we decide to run on,"" said Johnson. ""I was not suggesting repealing and replacing Obamacare should be one of those priorities. Even when we tried and failed, I consistently said our effort should focus on repairing the damage done by Obamacare and transitioning to a health system that works.""Which, well, ok! But, the problem for Johnson -- and for McConnell and other members of Republican leadership -- is that Johnson initially said what he said, which sounded a whole lot like Republicans would work to repeal and replace Obamacare if they were in the Senate majority.It's the latest problem for McConnell caused by members of his own conference, a series of self-inflicted wounds that give Democrats some hope that they may be able to retain their razor-thin majority in the Senate come November.Much of last week was taken up with a public back and forth between McConnell and Scott, the chair of Senate Republicans' campaign arm, over the Florida Republican's decision to release his own policy agenda for America if/when Republicans regain the majority. The provisions in Scott's plan include finishing construction of the southern border wall and naming it after former President Donald Trump, requiring all Americans to pay income taxes, and establishing a sunset provision for all federal legislation after five years. ""We will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half the American people, and sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years,"" McConnell said in response last week. ""That will not be a part of the Republican Senate majority agenda.""Not long after, Scott penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal arguing: ""If we have no bigger plan than to be a speed bump on the road to socialism, we don't deserve to govern. Most Republicans in Congress agree, but many live in fear of speaking the truth in Washington.""No sooner had that back and forth abated -- for the time being -- than this kerfuffle with Johnson sprung up, drawing swift Democratic condemnation. All of it works against McConnell's most basic premise heading into the 2022 midterms: Make the entire election a referendum on President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats. That notion appears to be harder to execute in practice than to follow in principle."

Madison Cawthorn's candidacy,"Wilmington, North Carolina (CNN)A federal judge on Friday shut down a legal challenge to GOP Rep. Madison Cawthorn's candidacy from a group of North Carolina voters and advocacy groups who claimed that an old provision of the US Constitution banned him from running because of his role on the January 6 insurrection. This means the constitutional challenge against Cawthorn is over, though Friday's ruling could be appealed. It's a major victory for the pro-Trump firebrand, and a loss for the coalition of constitutional scholars, anti-Trump Republicans and liberal activists who filed the challenge.The ruling was narrow, with Chief Judge Richard Myers concluding that a Civil War amnesty law passed by Congress in 1872 essentially repealed the 14th Amendment's ""disqualification clause,"" which prohibited officeholders from returning to elected positions if they supported an insurrection, but also said Congress could remove that disability with a two-thirds vote.  Myers agreed with Cawthorn's lawyers, who argued that the Amnesty Act of 1872 applied not only retroactively to Confederate officials, but also in perpetuity regarding future rebellions. Cawthorn has denied any wrongdoing regarding January 6 and says he isn't an insurrectionist. As part of their case against Cawthorn, the challengers highlighted the fact that he posted militant tweets in the run-up to January 6 and spoke at Trump's Ellipse rally before the attack. Read MoreMyers, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, handed down the ruling during a two-hour hearing at the federal courthouse in Wilmington, North Carolina, which featured arcane legal arguments and history lessons about the US Constitution, the post-Civil War amendments and how they apply today.""We are at a moment in which interest in free and fair elections is at its peak,"" Myers said, adding that it was his responsibility as a federal judge to protect ""the soapbox... the ballot box... and the jury box. And when those fail, that's when people proceed to the ammunition box.""The anti-Cawthorn campaign was backed by a legal advocacy group called Free Speech For People, as well as Our Revolution, the left-wing group founded by Sen. Bernie Sanders. They recruited North Carolina voters who live in Cawthorn's district to challenge his candidacy. After they filed their challenge with the North Carolina State Board of Elections, Cawthorn sued the board in federal court to shut down the process. If the judge hadn't intervened on Friday, the state election board would've eventually appointed a panel to hear the candidacy challenge, which would've had the power to depose Cawthorn or issue subpoenas for documents.  The federal case moved as a fast pace, and the judge agreed that Cawthorn needed legal relief quickly. North Carolina holds its primaries in May and will start printing ballots in the next several weeks. Debates over century-old laws The hearing was a striking display of the reality that America is grappling with a level of internal strife and democratic backsliding that hasn't been seen since the Civil War. The bulk of Friday's proceedings revolved around how century-old laws regarding insurrections apply to today. During the federal litigation, the North Carolina State Board of Elections was represented by lawyers from the state attorney general's office, which is run by a Democrat. They maintained that the election board had the power to hear the challenge and would've had the power to disqualify Cawthorn based on the 14th Amendment, if there was enough supporting evidence. State prosecutor Terence Steed said during Friday's hearing that the 1872 amnesty law only applied retroactively to Confederate officials and troops -- and not Cawthorn. He said Cawthorn was relying on an ""absurd interpretation"" of the law that ""defies logic"" to claim immunity. Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn cleans gun during virtual House hearing""The 1872 Amnesty Act did not absolve all future insurrections,"" Steed said, pointing out that Congress used the 14th Amendment to disqualify a socialist lawmaker from office in 1919. That's the same interpretation as a Gerard Magliocca, a law professor at Indiana University who is perhaps the leading scholar on the constitution's ""disqualification clause."" He was willing to testify on behalf of the challengers, and believes the old amnesty laws didn't shield Cawthorn. The judge disagreed -- but said his ruling was narrow and essentially applied only to Cawthorn. ""The ruling will be reversed on appeal,"" Magliocca told CNN in an interview after the hearing. ""There are many problems with the argument that the 1872 law conferred amnesty onto all people forever who would engage in insurrection against the US Constitution. That's not what it says. And nobody at the time thought that is what the law would do. Not a single person.""Advocacy group says ruling is 'absurd' Ron Fein, legal director of Free Speech For People, urged the state election board to appeal the decision immediately because the judge was ""wrong on the law"" and that his ruling was ""patently absurd."" (The board's lawyers declined to comment about any potential appeal.)""Until the decision is overturned on appeal, the state process is on pause, and Madison Cawthorn is temporarily shielded from answering questions about whether his involvement in January 6 disqualifies him under the Fourteenth Amendment,"" Fein said in a statement. The group previously said it will try to disqualify additional pro-Trump Republicans in other districts who supported the efforts to violently overturn the 2020 election. But Friday's ruling could derail those plans, or at least is a legal roadblock in one state. John Wallace, a Democratic lawyer who represented the challengers, said that ""the North Carolina voters who saw it fit to challenge Cawthorn's candidacy now won't have a chance to do so."" Cawthorn's team cheered the ruling, and echoed comments that the GOP lawmaker made last week, claiming that the candidacy challenge was an effort by left-wing groups to ""cancel"" him.  ""This is a concerted, well-funded national effort to undermine our democracy by disqualifying eligible people from running for office,"" Cawthorn lawyer James Bopp Jr. said after the hearing.This story has been updated with additional details."

(That gap expands to 13 points when you limit the sample to registered voters who say they are ""certain"" to vote.)That's known as the generic ballot test. For decades, it's been a reliable weathervane as to which way -- and how hard -- the partisan winds are blowing.  And what the ABC/Post poll makes clear is that the wind is blowing against the Democrats -- and hard.Read More How bad is it for Democrats? Consider where the generic ballot stood in ABC/Post polling taken just before other recent midterm elections: 2018: D+7 on generic ballot (Democrats won a net of 40 House seats) 2014: D+3 (Democrats lost a net of 13 seats) 2010: D+5 (Democrats lost a net of 64 seats) 2006: D+13 (Democrats won a net of 31 seats) What's clear is that when the Democratic edge is five points or less on the generic ballot, the party has experienced major seat losses in midterm elections. Now consider what the House playing field might look like with a Republican edge of seven points on the generic ballot. (Among independent voters, largely considered the swing votes in elections, Republicans have a 14-point edge on the generic ballot in the latest ABC/Post poll.)  Like I said: Catastrophic. Now, the counter-argument goes like this: 1) It's February 2022, not November 2022. 2) Redistricting across the country has severely constricted the number of competitive seats between the two parties. 3) After Republicans gained a net of 12 House seats in 2020, there is less low-hanging fruit out there.All true! And it still might not matter. The Point: Political waves tend to wash away members of Congress who looked safe and sound just a few months earlier. And if the generic ballot stays anywhere close to where it is today, Democrats could be facing a historically large wave."

And that year was not kind to him. In a new NPR/PBS/Marist College poll, more than half -- 56% -- of Americans said that Biden's first year in office was a ""failure,"" while just 39% described it as a success. The news doesn't get better the more you dig into the survey. Two-thirds of independents said Biden's first year was a failure, while more than 9 in 10 Republicans (91%) agreed with that assessment.Read More Biden's numbers are better among Democrats -- 80% called year one a success -- but 15% of members of his own party described his first year in office as a failure. Now, asking such a binary question -- either Biden's first year was a success or a failure, with no room in the middle -- does tend to strip any nuance from issue. There are incredible complexities that go into assessing how a president has done.  Oftentimes, a president is judged in one way during his time in office and in another after he leaves, once the impacts of his policies come into clearer focus. That said, elections tend to force voters to think in this all-or-nothing way. Either you vote for a Democrat or for a Republican. Either you vote to re-elect your incumbent or you choose the challenger.Seen through that political lens, these poll numbers are extremely problematic for Democrats on the ballot this fall. We know that, historically, the first midterm election of a president's term is a referendum on his time in office up to that point. The Point: If the public's report card on Biden's second year in office is anything like the one for his first year, Democrats can kiss their House and Senate majorities goodbye."

President Joe Biden's approval rating is stuck in the low 40s. Thirty House Democrats have already announced their plans to leave office at the end of the term. Republican enthusiasm is soaring. And yet, Mitch McConnell is still nervous.Read More ""People are thinking: Is there any way we can screw this up,"" the Senate minority leader said on Tuesday. ""Well, it's always possible. And so part of my job is to try to prevent us from screwing this up by nominating people for the Senate who can win the primary, but can't win the general."" He's not wrong! And there's plenty of relatively recent history McConnell can point to as evidence of the dangers of picking the wrong nominee. In 2010, Delaware Republicans opted for an unknown conservative named Christine O'Donnell rather than longtime GOP politician Mike Castle as their nominee. O'Donnell, who infamously ran an ad declaring that she was ""not a witch,"" lost to Democratic Sen. Chris Coons by a large margin in the general election. Two years later, Missouri Republicans chose then-Rep. Todd Akin as their nominee. Akin quickly disqualified himself with comments about ""legitimate rape."" Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill won the general election easily. Missouri -- past and present -- is likely on McConnell's mind these days. With Republican Sen. Roy Blunt retiring, the current polling frontrunner in the race is former Gov. Eric Greitens.The problem? Greitens resigned under pressure in 2018 after acknowledging an extramarital affair and facing allegations of blackmail, which he denied. ""It is not conservative to tie a woman up in your basement and assault her,"" said Rep. Vicky Hartzler, who is also running for the seat, referring to Greitens' scandal. (Greitens told CNN in a recent interview that he did ""absolutely"" nothing wrong.)  Republicans have expressed concern that if Greitens is their Senate nominee, they could well lose a seat that, based on recent presidential voting patterns, should be an easy hold for them. But many of those same Republicans admit that they may not be able to stop Greitens from winning. While Missouri is clearly the stickiest wicket for McConnell -- and Republicans more generally -- contested primaries in Ohio, Pennsylvania and North Carolina all present some level of political peril for the likes of McConnell, depending on who the party chooses to nominate. Looming over all this is former President Donald Trump, who has made clear that he plans to be actively involved in the 2022 primary season. Trump and McConnell are already on opposite sides of the Alaska Senate race, for instance, with McConnell supporting Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Trump backing challenger Kelly Tshibaka. The Point: Things looks very good for McConnell and Senate Republicans. But Trump and the GOP base voters who are loyal to him represent a massive x-factor that could badly complicate the party's math."

That much we know. The only question is whether the Fed will boost rates by a quarter of a percentage point or a half-point. Right now, it's looking like a toss-up.But there are some Wall Street experts who think Fed chair Jerome Powell and his fellow central bankers will look to do as much as they can to curb inflation now in order to avoid more rate hikes in the late summer and fall. Here's why the timing matters: Rate increases could — and likely will — have a negative impact on the markets and the economy. The Fed typically tries to steer clear of raising rates too close to an election, in this case the November midterms, to avoid any perception that its policies might benefit or hurt a particular party.""The Fed could front-end load some rate hikes so to avoid the midterms and stay apolitical,"" said Jeff Mortimer, director of investment strategy at BNY Mellon Wealth Management.Read MoreThe Fed will look at economic data, not the midterm pollsOthers argue that the last thing the Fed will want to do is base its decisions on political calculus. The central bank is staunchly apolitical and doesn't care about the calendar. Its so-called dual mandate is to maintain price stability and maximum employment, not ensure the status quo on Capitol Hill. That means the Fed needs to continue monitoring economic reports, and right now, inflation pressures still suggest that there will be more rate hikes in the near future.""The Fed can be political by not raising rates,"" said Victoria Fernandez, chief market strategist with Crossmark Global Investments. ""The best thing the Fed can do is ignore the fact that it's a midterm election year and focus on data.""That's exactly what the agency did four years ago during the last midterm cycle. To the dismay of then-President Donald Trump, the Powell-led Fed raised rates three times in 2018 before the midterms, including one hike in late September. The Democrats won control of the House from the Republicans in that election. (The Fed raised rates again in December that year.)

Powell himself was nominated to the Fed's Board of Governors by President Barack Obama in 2011.Erring on the side of cautionBoth Fernandez and Mortimer said they think the Fed will continue to be more reactive than proactive. They expect the bankers will act based on current data instead of trying to anticipate what the inflation numbers might look like in the next year. ""There is a lag effect to rate hikes.

If so, the Fed can then afford to take its foot off the gas. But she added that the central bank has to remain vigilant and try to ""squash rising prices,"" noting that inflation is like a ""hidden tax felt disproportionately by middle America.""""The Fed will only pause if inflation data cools this summer,"" Lu said. ""It can't afford to look political. It will remain loyal to the data. That's a blessing and a curse."""

In Ohio alone, four self-funding candidates have already combined to contribute nearly $30 million to their US Senate campaigns.   Mike Gibbons, a Cleveland-based businessman who made his fortune in real estate and investment banking, has loaned his campaign over $11 million. Matt Dolan, a state senator whose family owns the Cleveland Guardians baseball team, has directly contributed about $8 million to his campaign, and loaned it $2.5 million more.

And former state GOP chair Jane Timken, whose family owns a Canton-based steel company, has loaned her campaign about $3.5 million.  The flood of money has produced a deluge of advertising in the competitive Republican Senate primary in Ohio. Through the second week of February, Buckeye State voters had already seen over $15 million worth of TV ads. Nearly $10 million more has been reserved through the date of the primary, still months away on May 3.

In Arizona, Republican Jim Lamon -- whose energy company was purchased by Koch Industries last year -- has loaned his campaign $8 million. In Pennsylvania, celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz has already loaned his campaign for the GOP nomination more than $5 million. As in Ohio, millions worth of TV ads have aired already in both states, driven in large part by the spending of these self-funding candidates.   Self-funding in 2022 is not a strictly partisan phenomenon. In Wisconsin, Democratic Senate hopeful Alex Lasry, whose family owns the Milwaukee Bucks NBA franchise, has loaned his campaign nearly $2.4 million.

In Florida, Democrat Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, a home health care executive who won a special election for the 20th Congressional District last month, loaned her campaign nearly $6 million (and has repaid herself about $2 million of that total.) Cody Reynolds, a Democratic candidate for Oregon's 6th district, reported loaning his campaign $2 million. And Elijah Norton, a Republican mounting a primary challenge to incumbent Rep. David Schweikert in Arizona, has loaned his campaign about $2 million as well.  Advertising advantageThe ability to pour millions directly into one's own campaign is a significant advantage for these self-funding candidates. Candidate campaigns receive preferential TV advertising rates compared with outside groups like super PACs, which means the money goes further when it comes from a campaign versus an outside group.  ""While money doesn't buy outcomes, it certainly buys advertisements, and to the first consumer of those advertisements, they don't know who's paying for the ad,"" said Sarah Bryner, a strategist at the watchdog group OpenSecrets. The proliferation of self-funders can harm lesser-known candidates who aren't independently wealthy from breaking through, Bryner added. Though these self-funders may not ultimately win their respective contests, they can blunt momentum for their rivals early on by crowding out the field. Self-funding candidates also make the case that their wealth affords them political independence and that they aren't reliant on special interests or megadonors who could influence their positions. Former President Donald Trump made this argument central to his presidential primary campaign in 2015.   ""I'm using my own money. I'm not using the lobbyists. I'm not using donors. I don't care. I'm really rich,"" the former President said when he announced his White House bid. Trump ultimately contributed or loaned over $66 million to his 2016 campaign but contributed nothing to his 2020 reelection coffers.  Some high-profile failuresWhile self-funded campaigns enjoy some considerable advantages, they've had a mixed record at the polls. Michael Bloomberg spent over $1 billion on his campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, blanketing national airwaves with advertising. But he failed to win a single state nominating contest. One of his opponents in that race, billionaire Tom Steyer, spent about $350 million, to similar results.   ""They come in. They make a big splash, buy a lot of advertising. It's all paid for by their own money. And it doesn't really move the needle with the polling,"" said Bryner. More recently, Georgia GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler loaned her 2020 campaign $23 million, but she was ultimately defeated in a special election runoff by the grassroots-funded effort of Democrat Raphael Warnock.    Whether self-funders win or lose, their ability to pour money into elections can have adverse effects for less wealthy candidates -- crowding out contenders, driving up advertising costs, and raising the barrier to entry for those lacking millions of dollars to spend on politics.  But Democrat Mandela Barnes, Wisconsin's lieutenant governor who is also running for Senate, said he doesn't see the self-funders as a threat because his large grassroots coalition has helped him raise a significant amount of small-dollar donations -- campaign finance reports show he raised $972,000 in donations under $200 through December 31. Barnes said the average donation to his campaign is about $46 out of nearly 50,000 individual donations, many of them from teachers. ""Our small-dollar donors from across the state more than make up for the fact that I'm not able to afford to self-fund this race,"" he said."

It's not that the polls are ""wrong."" Rather, it's that most polls at this point are asking all registered voters who they're going to vote for in November, when it's likely only a distinct subset of voters who will cast a ballot. ","politics, Why polls may be underestimating Republicans - CNNPolitics",Why polls may be underestimating Republicans,"(CNN)Most polls you're looking at right now are likely underestimating Republicans' position heading into the midterm election cycle. It's not that the polls are ""wrong."" Rather, it's that most polls at this point are asking all registered voters who they're going to vote for in November, when it's likely only a distinct subset of voters who will cast a ballot. The voters who will actually turn out for the fall election are likely going to be disproportionately Republican based on current polling data and history. Take a gander at our CNN/SSRS poll from last week. It featured a rather close race when all registered voters were asked who they would vote for if the election for Congress was held now. The generic Republican candidate garnered 44% to the generic Democratic candidate's 43% -- a result well within the margin of error. This poll is basically in line with the average of all polls, which has generally featured a low single digit Republican advantage on the generic ballot. If that held through November, Republicans would be small favorites to take back the House. Democrats winning the House popular vote and holding on to control given how redistricting has gone (relatively well for Democrats) would be quite plausible.The election is still well over half a year away and we obviously don't know who will turn out in November -- hence, why we are not whittling down the electorate just yet.  Read MoreDig into the poll a little more, and you can see where Democrats' problem lies, though. Our CNN poll asked respondents how enthusiastic they were about voting in this year's election ""extremely, very, somewhat, not too or not enthusiastic at all.""Among those who said they were extremely enthusiastic (24%), Republicans held a 59% to 39% lead over Democrats on the generic congressional ballot. If we expand our universe to include those who were very enthusiastic as well (43% of all voters) of all voters, Republicans were ahead 55% to 42%. No matter how you measure enthusiasm, the voters who are most enthusiastic about voting this year lean Republican. A similar signal was seen in an NBC News poll last month in which Republicans registered far more interest in the upcoming midterms than Democrats, so this poll is no outlier. Of course, a vote cast by an enthusiastic voter is worth the same as a vote cast by an unenthusiastic voter. The fact is, though, that enthusiastic voters have been more likely to say they'll cast a ballot than unenthusiastic voters, at least in CNN polling historically. The relationship isn't perfect, but it's clear one exists. In the final poll before the last midterm in 2018, voters were asked the enthusiasm question as well as how likely they were to vote on a scale from definitely not to definitely will/already have. Among those who said they were extremely enthusiastic to vote, 96% said they were definitely going to vote or had already voted. A relatively low 73% of those who were not extremely likely to vote said they were definitely voting or had already voted. This dropped to 64% among those who were not extremely or very enthusiastic. Of course, the exact levels of enthusiasm between the parties could easily differ between now and Election Day. It's also true that the party that has been more enthusiastic about voting at this point in the campaign has been more enthusiastic to vote in the final CNN poll asking about enthusiasm before the midterm. Republicans were more enthusiastic in 2010 and 2014, while Democrats were more enthusiastic in 2018. The party that was more enthusiastic at this point went on to major gains in the November elections.  Indeed, history would need to be upended for there not to be a significant difference between the voting patterns between registered voters and midterm voters who turn out to vote.In a previous story, I examined the difference in party identification between all registered voters and those who actually voted in midterm elections since 1978 in post-election surveys from the ANES and CES. The years in which there was a Republican president (like in 2018), there was a minimal difference in the party identification between midterm voters and voters overall. In years in which there was a Democratic president (like right now), Republicans on average made up 5 points more of the midterm voter pool than registered voter pool. In none of the years with a Democratic president did Republican turnout advantage shrink below 3 points. Averaging across different national pre-election generic ballot polls in both 2010 and 2014, we see how this impacted the result. The Republican lead widened by about 5.6 points and 4.8 points on average in 2010 and 2014 respectively. In other words, it was very close to what we'd expect given what the ANES and CES signaled. Could 2022 be different? Past isn't always prologue, but history does seem more likely than not to repeat itself. Beyond the polling we have nationally right now, the polling ahead of the Virginia gubernatorial election a few months ago painted a similar picture. Fox and the Washington Post, two national pollsters, who presented registered and likely voter results in that race found Republican Glenn Youngkin doing 5 points better on average with likely than registered voters. He would go on to win the election. Anyway you look at it, Democrats are probably in considerably worse shape at this point than polls of registered voters on the generic ballot might lead you to believe."

The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022For Republicans, the stakes are different -- and, in many ways, much higher.Read MoreIn GOP nominating contests across the country, up and down the ballot, the usual issues are largely taking a backseat to basic questions about democracy and whether the Republicans candidates are willing to acknowledge Trump's 2020 loss and to defend the democratic process.The first round of primaries begin on March 1 in Texas. Nominees will be decided in big contests on May 3, when Ohio goes to the polls, and two weeks later as Pennsylvania and North Carolina vote: All three states, like Alabama (May 24), Missouri (August 2) and Vermont (August 9) are going to fill open Senate seats.There will also be an unusual amount of attention paid this year to state legislative races.

And with nine months to go until the midterm elections, here is CNN's latest look at the 10 Senate seats most likely to flip, as of right now.","politics, The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 - CNNPolitics",The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022,"(CNN)There's nothing like a Supreme Court vacancy to get people in Washington talking about the Senate.  It's less clear, however, whether the voters who will decide control of the Senate nine months from now are attuned to that conversation, especially since the ideological makeup of the court is not in the balance.  Justice Stephen Breyer's decision to retire came as President Joe Biden's approval rating stood at 42%, with 55% disapproving, according to CNN's average of six recent national polls. The best scenario for Democrats is that the vacancy and Biden's pledge to nominate a Black woman will help drive base enthusiasm and remind moderates who care about abortion rights, for example, of what's at stake in the battle for the Senate. But that may be a lot of theoretical dot-connecting for most Americans preoccupied with high prices at the pump and the checkout line.  Still, the seat most likely to flip partisan control is the place where Democrats see the Supreme Court vacancy as having perhaps the biggest impact. That's not a new development: Pennsylvania has led the list since CNN started ranking the 2022 races nearly a year ago. But it speaks to the demographics Democrats need to turn out in the Keystone State -- their urban base and suburban voters.  The ranking is based on CNN's reporting and fundraising data, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. Fundraising reports for the fourth quarter of 2021, which were due to the Federal Election Commission by Monday, showed some Democrats raising massive sums of money, while some Republican candidates poured significant personal wealth into their campaigns. As the year progresses, more polling and advertising spending data will become bigger factors in the ranking.  
Read MoreWhile Pennsylvania still leads the list, Republicans are feeling more confident about the seat, which GOP Sen. Pat Toomey is vacating, than they have in months, thanks to some new candidates. But it remains a question, as is the case in several other races, how much embracing former President Donald Trump in the primary comes back to haunt the eventual GOP nominee in the general election in a state Biden won in 2020.  As he resumes his campaign-style rallies, with a heavy focus on his 2020 election lies, Trump is signaling that he won't be sitting 2022 out quietly, even if he's not on the ballot. The jockeying for his support has already led to massive spending -- especially in Pennsylvania, where the GOP primary has attracted $18 million, mostly in December and January alone, according to a CNN analysis of AdImpact data.  ""I still say it's 50-50,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told CNN's Manu Raju last week about the GOP's chances of flipping the chamber. The Kentucky Republican backed the bipartisan infrastructure law, one of Biden's biggest achievements to date, but he's standing in the way (along with two moderate Democrats) of the President's other priorities, such as his social spending and climate change plan and voting rights legislation, both of which stalled in the Senate.  Trump team announces $122 million war chestVulnerable Democratic incumbents on this list -- Sens. Mark Kelly, Catherine Cortez Masto, Maggie Hassan and Raphael Warnock -- all voted in favor of eliminating the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation. While taking that position has become a new litmus test of sorts in Democratic primaries (again, see Pennsylvania), and some Republicans are attacking Democrats over it, it's far from clear that the fate of the 60-vote threshold is a salient issue for American voters. There's been plenty of effort to get voters' attention. Candidates and outside groups have already spent twice as much on TV and radio ads as they had at similar points in the 2018 and 2020 cycles, according to a CNN analysis of AdImpact data.   Look for that spending to increase quickly ahead of spring primaries, with the first big Senate contest of the year (Ohio) happening on May 3. Until then, stay tuned for more updates to this ranking. Here are the top 10 Senate seats most likely to flip as of this month:  1. PennsylvaniaIncumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)Pennsylvania remains the seat most likely to flip, although Republicans feel better about holding retiring Sen. Pat Toomey's seat now that the Trump-backed candidate is out of the race and several new candidates have jumped in. ""We have an embarrassment of riches,"" McConnell told Raju in late January. The biggest new name is hedge fund executive David McCormick. A former Treasury official in the George W. Bush administration who lived in Connecticut for years, McCormick has rolled out ads trying to convince voters that ""his Pennsylvania roots will keep him grounded."" He's the husband of Dina Powell McCormick, who was Trump's deputy national security adviser. Sean Parnell, the Trump endorsee who suspended his campaign after a public custody battle that was generating worrisome headlines for the GOP, quickly backed McCormick, as did Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who recently rallied with him in the state. McCormick and his allies are already in a sniping contest with Dr. Mehmet Oz, who entered the race late last fall and had loaned his campaign more than $5 million, according to his recent FEC filing. Honor Pennsylvania, an anti-Oz group, is attacking the former talk show host as a ""Hollywood liberal."" (Like McCormick, Oz recently lived out of state, in New Jersey.) American Leadership Action, a pro-Oz group, is going after McCormick's business record, as is Oz's campaign. There were already Republicans running here -- allies of businessman Jeff Bartos, for example, are attacking the two newcomers as carpetbaggers -- and Carla Sands, who was ambassador to Denmark under Trump, loaned her campaign another $500,000 in the fourth quarter. While Democrats are enjoying watching Republicans duke it out, they have their own crowded primary. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman is still the fundraising leader, raising $2.7 million in the fourth quarter. Rep. Conor Lamb -- who, like Fetterman, is from the western part of the state -- has picked up some labor endorsements and the backing of the mayor of Philadelphia. He finished ahead of the other candidates in a state party committee vote last weekend but fell short of the threshold for an endorsement. 2. GeorgiaIncumbent: Democrat Raphael WarnockAfter winning a special election runoff last winter that helped flip the Senate, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock never slowed down. He raised $9.8 million in the fourth quarter as he seeks a full six-year term in November. Only a sum like that could make the nearly $5.4 million that Republican challenger Herschel Walker raised seem paltry. Since Biden won the state in 2020, Georgia has remained one of the most interesting political battlegrounds that's also home to a high-profile gubernatorial race and is ground zero for the fight for voting rights, which Democrats hope could energize turnout on their side. With the national spotlight on his state, Warnock isn't likely to be hurting for money anytime soon. And while staggering Democratic fundraising hasn't always translated to success (see South Carolina in 2020 or Texas in 2018), public polling suggests this race is competitive. A recent Quinnipiac University poll showed no clear leader, with Walker at 49% and Warnock at 48% among registered voters. Republicans are feeling confident about this race now that McConnell and Trump are united behind Walker, even if the former NFL star remains largely untested as a candidate, and because the national environment has looked increasingly strong for them. Biden's job approval rating in the Peach State in that Quinnipiac poll, for example, was 36%. But Democrats take heart that Warnock's job approval was a higher 47%. With Senate races so nationalized these days, Warnock will need to continue to overperform Biden -- as he did in 2021 -- if he's going to survive in November, regardless of how many millions he raises.  3. WisconsinIncumbent: Republican Ron JohnsonThe big news here is GOP Sen. Ron Johnson is running for reelection, which reassured Republicans and enthused Democrats. Republicans are glad to be avoiding another messy primary, and they're thankful Johnson didn't wait even longer to make his announcement. In a video explaining his decision, Johnson says he intended for his current term to be his last but cannot ""walk away"" after seeing ""the Democrats in total control."" Democrats, however, are thrilled that Johnson -- who has continued to make controversial and misleading statements about Covid-19 and January 6 -- is running. They believe he's a damaged enough incumbent that it will be easier to flip this seat with him in it than if he weren't. Senate Majority PAC, the preeminent Democratic super PAC, quickly attacked Johnson for being ""deep in the swamp."" Johnson's announcement also prompted the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to launch its first TV ad of the cycle, hitting him for ""looking out for himself."" Republicans think a strong national environment will help them hold on to this seat, especially if they can paint the eventual Democratic nominee as too far left for the state, which backed Biden by less than a point in 2020. They're excited about the prospect of running against Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, for example, who has the support of Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Barnes raised $1.2 million in the fourth quarter -- which is more than Johnson's $711,000 but lower than some Democratic challengers across the country. And he faces a crowded primary, including Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry, who loaned his campaign about $1.5 million in the fourth quarter and has been running a series of ads on TV.  4. ArizonaIncumbent: Democrat Mark KellyDemocratic Sen. Mark Kelly, like Warnock in Georgia, continues to post impressive fundraising numbers as he runs for a full six-year term in November. Kelly raised nearly $9 million in the last quarter. That, on its own, should put Republicans on notice in an increasingly purple state that Biden narrowly won in 2020. But unlike Georgia, where the GOP has largely coalesced around one candidate, Republicans here face a real headache with a messy candidate field ahead of the August primary. There have been renewed rumors about Gov. Doug Ducey running, which would please McConnell and national Republicans, but he's a frequent target of Trump and doesn't appear to have made any moves ahead of the April filing deadline. That leaves Attorney General Mark Brnovich, whose fundraising continues to be underwhelming (he raised about $800,000 last quarter) and venture capitalist Blake Masters, among several others, duking it out. Masters raised nearly $1.6 million, but he also has the advantage of a Peter Thiel-backed super PAC touting him as a ""Trump conservative."" Based on the advertising in the state -- which has already crept past $30 million, according to CNN's analysis of AdImpact data as of Friday -- Republicans are leaning into the Trump loyalty contest. Solar energy entrepreneur Jim Lamon, for example, who loaned his campaign $3 million in the fourth quarter, is going all-in on Trump's claims of a rigged election. Regardless of their nominee, Republicans think it's a winnable race, especially if the national environment continues to look bleak for Biden and other Democrats, and they're eager to go after Kelly's voting record and exploit the differences between him and his more moderate Democratic Arizona colleague, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema.  5. NevadaIncumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez MastoThis is one of the few contests, like Georgia, where Trump and McConnell have already united behind the same candidate. In Nevada, it's former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, the grandson of the former governor and senator with the same last name. The GOP's ability to coalesce around him ahead of the June primary could be critical to winning the seat, but he still faces competition. Retired Army Capt. Sam Brown raised about $1 million in the fourth quarter, just shy of Laxalt's $1.3 million. Republicans are hopeful that Biden's sagging approval ratings and voters' anxieties will help them in the state, which has seen its share of pandemic and inflation woes. ""I don't know if it's the President, or what happened, but (under Trump) it was so much better,"" one Nevada voter who has recently voted for Democrats told CNN's Maeve Reston in early January. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, the former chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, raised about $3.3 million last quarter and hasn't yet really reintroduced herself to voters. Democrats have long believed that abortion could be a salient issue here -- especially since Laxalt's opposition to abortion rights puts him at odds with the state's most recent GOP governor -- and are hoping the Supreme Court vacancy will help bring more attention to that contrast by reminding voters what's at stake. But Republicans' inroads with Hispanics, combined with the state's non-college-educated White population, make this race among the most competitive.  6. North CarolinaIncumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)Trump's endorsement in this race nearly eight months ago has yet to clear the GOP field, with none of the candidates posting stellar fundraising. In fact, former Rep. Mark Walker announced last week that he would carry on with his Senate campaign rather than drop down to a House race with the possibility of an endorsement from the ex-President. Rep. Ted Budd, Trump's pick for Senate, raised $968,000 in the fourth quarter and continues to introduce himself to voters statewide, while the Club for Growth's political arm spends big to help him. That includes going hard after former Gov. Pat McCrory, who raised $748,000. Combat veteran Marjorie K. Eastman raised $423,000 and is less well known but has benefited from nearly $1 million in outside spending from a group called Restore Common Sense. The delay in the state's primaries from March to May, thanks to redistricting litigation, will give Republicans more time to sort out their field. Democrats, meanwhile, have a prohibitive favorite in former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley after other major candidates dropped out. She raised $2.1 million in the last quarter. While Republicans likely start with the advantage in this state that Trump carried by about a point in 2020, Democrats are hopeful Beasley can energize minority turnout in a non-presidential year.  7. New HampshireIncumbent: Democrat Maggie HassanDemocratic Sen. Maggie Hassan got a huge break when Republican Gov. Chris Sununu decided late last year to run for reelection rather than challenge her. Besides retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, several other Republicans are now hoping to take on Hassan, although none of Sununu's stature. Londonderry Town Manager Kevin Smith, who unsuccessfully sought the GOP gubernatorial nod in 2012, announced his campaign last month. State Senate President Chuck Morse followed over the weekend, riding a skid-steer loader into his snowy announcement event, WMUR reported. McConnell singled out Morse in his interview with CNN last week, saying, ""We think we'll have a good candidate there."" Democrats have done well in the Granite State in recent federal elections, with Biden carrying the state by 7 points in 2020. But his approval rating slipped last fall, giving Republicans hope they'd unseat Hassan even without their preferred candidate. Biden's numbers had somewhat improved by mid-December, returning to July levels, according to the most recent University of New Hampshire Granite State Poll. Hassan, who raised $3.2 million in the last quarter, isn't in as competitive a race as she could have been had Sununu thrown his hat in the ring, but she still has to hope that the national environment doesn't endanger her. Only 28% of New Hampshire residents in that Granite State Poll, for example, said things in the US ""are headed in the right direction.""  8. Florida Incumbent: Republican Marco RubioGOP Sen. Marco Rubio is running for a third term in a state that has favored Republicans recently. (Trump carried it by 3 points in 2020.) That means he starts as the favorite, but Democratic Rep. Val Demings, who was a contender for Biden's running mate, has been an impressive fundraiser. She raised about $7.2 million in the fourth quarter -- more than Rubio's $5.2 million, although he ended 2021 with more cash on hand. Demings will need the money to introduce herself statewide across expensive media markets. Rubio has recently been touting his support from law enforcement, trying to counter any advantages Demings might bring to the race as a former Orlando police chief. The congresswoman responded last week by calling Rubio a ""lifelong politician,"" saying that during her tenure with the police she had helped respond to ""some dark, scary places"" while he was ""home in his bed sleeping,"" according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel. 9. OhioIncumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)The Republican primary field to replace retiring GOP Sen. Rob Portman remains unsettled ahead of the May primary as candidates and their allies frantically put out polls to try to shape their own narratives of the race. The Club for Growth's political arm is spending for former state Treasurer Josh Mandel, attacking ""Hillbilly Elegy"" author J.D. Vance and former state party Chair Jane Timken. Almost all the candidates, including a couple of big-spending businessmen, are leaning heavily into Trump's rhetoric, creating a sharp distinction from the senator they're hoping to succeed. Vance claimed in a tweet thread on the anniversary of the US Capitol insurrection that many of the rioters in a DC jail are ""political prisoners,"" adding, ""They are our people."" He also recently secured the endorsement of controversial GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, which he likely hopes will blunt some of his past public criticism of Trump. State Sen. Matt Dolan was the rare candidate to describe January 6 as ""an attack on American democracy"" in a statement on the one-year anniversary, calling out ""fake conservatives willing to sacrifice our most sacred text, the Constitution, in favor of political expedience."" He's invested a stunning $10.5 million of his own money into his campaign (mostly in contributions, not loans) but faces a steep uphill battle in a GOP primary that revolves around Trump. On the Democratic side, Rep. Tim Ryan, who raised $2.9 million last quarter, has largely consolidated support, but Ohio, which Trump carried by 8 points, remains a tough state for anyone in his party who's not Sen. Sherrod Brown. 10. MissouriIncumbent: Republican Roy Blunt (retiring)Missouri is different from most of the states on this list in that it really wouldn't be here if it weren't for one man. ""Missouri is potentially challenging depending on the outcome in the primary,"" McConnell told Raju. Former Gov. Eric Greitens, who resigned from office following a probe into allegations of sexual and campaign misconduct, threatens to put in play a red state that Trump won by 15 points in 2020. He's trying to align himself with Trump, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, the fiancée of the ex-President's son, is his campaign's national chair. Greitens faces a handful of Republicans also trying to secure Trump's support ahead of the August primary. Rep. Billy Long, for example, ran an ad about Democrats ""rigging the election."" State Attorney General Eric Schmitt recently announced lawsuits against school districts with masking rules, which is becoming a conservative rallying cry as the third year of the pandemic gets underway. GOP Rep. Vicky Hartzler -- the only woman in the race -- hasn't hesitated to go after Greitens, taking an implicit jab at his extramarital affair in her first ad released last fall. The fear is that Greitens could jeopardize the general election much like GOP nominee Todd Akin did in the 2012 Senate contest. And the more Republicans in the race, the more splintered the primary vote will be, thereby lowering the threshold Greitens would need to win the nomination. Democrat Lucas Kunce raised $710,000 in the fourth quarter -- more than any of the Republicans excluding personal loans. But the Marine veteran will need more than money to make the race go his way.  CNN's David Wright contributed to this report."

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.We're devoting this newsletter to redistricting -- the once-a-decade process of redrawing the lines for congressional districts to reflect population shifts after the US Census.The main goal, as enshrined in the Constitution, is straightforward: US House seats should be equally apportioned among the states. New maps, then, must be drawn to reflect where the population has grown or shrunk.The process sounds simple -- yet it is anything but that.And gerrymandering -- the practice of drawing maps to benefit a political party or a group of voters -- has helped make American politics more partisan. Districts have grown more homogenous, dominated by Republican voters or Democratic voters. If a congressional seat is safe from any real competition on Election Day, what incentive remains for a member of Congress to negotiate with the opposing party to actually accomplish something?Read MoreWe've turned to three in-house experts who are following the issue closely -- Ethan Cohen and Melissa Holzberg DePalo, who are producers for CNN's Political Unit, and CNN Politics' justice writer Tierney Sneed -- to explain redistricting and to give CITIZEN BY CNN readers the latest developments.Here's Ethan and Melissa:Who draws the maps? When redistricting works like it's supposed to, congressional district maps are drawn by either state lawmakers or by state redistricting commissions. But like many best-laid plans, that's not what has happened in every state. Courts have had to draw or choose the maps in six states, either because the normal processes failed to produce a plan (usually when control of state government is split between the parties) or because the produced maps failed to comply with legal standards.  Where do things stand today with redistricting? Is it over yet? We're about eight months from Election Day and the redistricting process still isn't finished, delayed in part by the pandemic-driven late release of the census data required.  Four states -- Florida, Missouri, New Hampshire and Louisiana -- still have yet to enact their final maps. In all four of those states, congressional maps are passed just like other legislation. Republicans have full control of state government in the first three states, but they haven't passed maps amid intra-GOP disputes about how aggressively to draw the lines.  In Louisiana, the state legislature recently passed a new map, but Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards hasn't announced whether he'll sign it. And as litigation over newly drawn maps continues across the country, it's possible maps in other states will need to be revised as well.  What's been the biggest surprise about redistricting? Republicans control most state legislatures across the country, so going into this redistricting process, a lot of analysts believed the GOP would be able to benefit significantly from new maps -- especially since the party is trying to regain control of the House in November.  But Democrats have had legal victories in states like Pennsylvania and North Carolina that resulted in more favorable maps. Democrats have also been able to utilize their advantage in states like New York, where they control the redistricting process.  They now have a chance to come out better than expected, and perhaps even benefit from the new maps overall.   However, Democrats still face an uphill climb to hold the House this November as they deal with President Joe Biden's low approval numbers and the historic trend of poor midterm performance from the party that controls the White House.  Two of the strangest terms to arise about drawing congressional maps are ""cracking"" and ""packing."" What do they mean and how do they work?In the simplest terms, ""cracking"" and ""packing"" are two ways congressional map-drawers gerrymander districts. Cracking is when mapmakers weaken a particular group's influence by spreading those voters throughout several districts. And packing is when specific voters are forced into one district, or as few districts as possible, to condense their influence.  Tennessee Republicans gave us a good idea of what cracking looks like this year. For most of Tennessee's history, Nashville has been in one congressional district. And for most of modern political history, in a sea of deep-red Tennessee, Nashville's district consistently sent Democrats to Congress. But this year, Republicans in the state divided Davidson County, where Nashville is, into three congressional districts that are paired with more conservative and rural parts of the state. That split, or crack, will weaken the influence of the more liberal Nashville population.  It also should be noted that Republicans aren't the only ones engaged in partisan map drawing. In states like New Mexico, Illinois and New York, Democrats drew lines to benefit their partisan interests. Here's Tierney:Where are the big legal fights happening and what are they about?With each redistricting cycle, the legal fight over partisan advantage in map-drawing seems to get more complicated. And this cycle is no exception. In 2019, the US Supreme Court said that federal courts could not play a role in policing partisan gerrymandering. So, some of the most impactful legal fights this cycle are playing out in state courts, where voters have challenged maps for giving one party too much of an advantage.Federal courts still have the authority to review claims of racial gerrymandering. Depending on the facts on the ground, maps alleged to be racially discriminatory can be challenged under the Voting Rights Act (VRA), under the Constitution or both. However, the Supreme Court has signaled that it may soon scale back the scope of the VRA in redistricting, which would leave voters, political parties and voter rights organizations with even fewer options to challenge unfair maps in court. In the lawsuits that are alleging that the political power of minority voters is being diluted, we are seeing a lot of arguments about how communities of color have grown in places like Texas and Georgia, with cases claiming that the new maps do not adequately reflect that growth. In Texas, for instance, people of color made up 95% of the population growth that led to the state being awarded two additional seats in the US House this decade. Yet both of those districts were drawn to have White voting majorities, as the Justice Department argued in the lawsuit it brought against the state. Americans already have begun to vote in primaries, so how will these court cases affect actual elections?  It depends on the state. In some states, like Texas and Georgia, the current lawsuits won't change the maps before this year's election.  Part of the issue legal challengers have run into is that maps were drawn much later last year than usual. That is because the Covid-19 pandemic delayed the 2020 Census -- which produces the data for each decade's redrawing of maps -- which, in turn, delayed the release date for the data from that survey. In some states, legislators or courts pushed back their electoral calendars because of coronavirus-created time crunch. But we're still seeing the legal fights over the maps run into election deadlines. In Ohio, for example, local election officials and GOP state leaders are sparring over whether to move the May 3 primary date as the redistricting commission has repeatedly seen its maps rejected by the Ohio Supreme Court. Another complication -- particularly in the federal redistricting litigation -- is a recent move by the Supreme Court that has discouraged lower courts from disturbing the maps for this years' election, even when those courts think the maps violate the law. Alabama earlier this year had been ordered by two federal courts to redraw its congressional map, after the courts found it likely violated the Voting Rights Act by diluting the political power of Black voters. But at Alabama's request, the Supreme Court, by a 5-4 vote, intervened to put that order on hold. The full majority didn't explain its reasoning, but Justice Brett Kavanaugh, joined by Justice Samuel Alito, wrote a concurrence that touted a legal principle of avoiding court actions that could cause confusion among voters.Justice Elena Kagan, one of the court's liberal justices, shot back in a dissent: ""Alabama is not entitled to keep violating Black Alabamians' voting rights just because the court's order came down in the first month of an election year."" Already, a district judge in Georgia has cited the Supreme Court's move in Alabama to explain he would not order Georgia to redraw its state legislative maps for its coming elections, even though the judge believes that they violated the Voting Rights Act. Where's the Supreme Court on all of this?  As you may have picked up by now, the Supreme Court -- particularly this current conservative majority -- has generally shown more sympathy to legislators who have drawn potentially unfair or discriminatory maps than they have to the voters seeking to challenge those plans. The Supreme Court's 2015 Shelby County decision set the stage for this trend. In that case, the conservative majority gutted a provision in the Voting Rights Act that required states with a history of racial discrimination in voting practices to get federal approval for their redistricting plans (and any other changes to their election policies).Since then, the court majority gave Texas key wins in a redistricting racial discrimination case stemming from the 2010 census cycle. The 2019 partisan redistricting decision, known as Rucho v. Common Cause put an end to any hopes that federal courts could rein in maps aggressively skewed towards one party or another. Though the court hasn't weighed in on the merits of the Alabama case, its willingness to jump in at the preliminary stage it was in suggests the court is going to scale back the Voting Rights Act's reach in redistricting once again, by making it harder for legal challengers to prove that maps can be drawn in way that don't undermine minority voters. However, in a setback for Republicans, the Supreme Court on Monday rebuffed efforts to disturb maps adopted by state courts in Pennsylvania and North Carolina.While the 2022 elections in Pennsylvania and North Carolina will be conducted with redistricting plans less favorable to Republicans, the Supreme Court's conservative wing has signaled an interest in considering a case down the road that would limit the ability of state courts to rein in partisan gerrymanders.You need to readCNN's interactive that explores Census data to show how America has grown more diverse and more multiracial than ever before.Kaanita Iyer's story for CNN on fears that redistricting battles in Alabama and other states will lead to voter suppression.CNN's Steve Contorno's look at GOP Florida Gov.

The court -- over the noted dissents of Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch -- turned away an emergency request from Republican legislators to use a different map that would be more favorable to their party. Supreme Court declines to revive Bill Cosby prosecutionFor Pennsylvania, the court rejected an emergency request from a group of six Republican voters who wanted to freeze a ruling from the commonwealth's high court that allowed the maps to take effect and altered the general primary calendar. There were no noted dissents from the two-sentence order.Closely watched caseThe North Carolina case especially had been closely followed by election law experts because lawyers for Republican legislators had asked the Supreme Court to adopt a theory that state courts cannot interpret their own state constitutions when it comes to redistricting and rules related to federal elections.Read MoreThe theory is called the ""Independent State Legislature claim"" in legalese. The Electors Clause of the US Constitution vests ""state legislatures"" with the power to appoint presidential electors ""in the manner"" they choose. The Elections Clause gives them control over the ""Times, Places and Manner"" of holding elections. Under the theory being pushed, ""legislature"" excludes a role for state courts.Judge shuts down January 6-based challenge to Rep. Madison Cawthorn's candidacyIf a majority of the court were ever to adopt those arguments, it could profoundly change the landscape of election law, upending the power of state courts to rely on state laws in disputes over federal elections. The theory attracted some members of the court's right wing in the past during litigation surrounding then-President Donald Trump's quest to use the courts to overturn Joe Biden's presidential election victory.The North Carolina Supreme Court held that the congressional map was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander under North Carolina law, saying that the General Assembly must not ""dilute any individual's vote on the basis of partisan affiliation."" The congressional maps are ""unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt"" under several clauses of the North Carolina Constitution, it added. The state Supreme Court ordered a trial court to prepare new maps.RELATED: Judge shuts down January 6-based challenge to Rep. Madison Cawthorn's candidacyNorth Carolina is divided into 14 congressional districts, having gained an additional seat after the 2020 census due to an increase in the state population.In court papers, lawyers for the legislators said the state Supreme Court's actions ""nullify the North Carolina General Assembly's regulations of the manner of holding federal elections in the State and replaces them with new regulations of the judiciary's design."" They said the North Carolina Supreme Court's actions ""are fundamentally irreconcilable"" with the federal Constitution.A coalition of voting rights groups, Democratic voters and the state's board of elections urged the US Supreme Court to stay out of the dispute. They said that if the justices were to intervene now it would cause confusion and delay as well as ""severe administrative difficulties.""After the order, Neal Katyal, a lawyer for the coalition of groups, praised the court's decision. ""By denying this stay, the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized in line with many precedents that there is no constitutional basis for attempting to rewrite the North Carolina Supreme Court's decision at the 11th hour,"" said Katyal. ""By leaving intact the decision by the North Carolina Supreme Court, the U.S. Supreme Court has paved the way for elections to proceed with the legislative and Congressional maps as ordered by the state courts,"" he added.Conservative dissentsAlito, Thomas and Gorsuch would have ruled in favor of the Republican legislators from North Carolina. They said in their dissent that the case presented an ""exceptionally important and recurring question of constitutional law"" concerning ""the extent of a state court's authority to reject rules adopted by a state legislature for use in conducting federal elections."" The dissenters said the case at hand had presented a good opportunity to consider the issue, ""but unfortunately the Court has again found the occasion inopportune.""They said the Republicans will be ""irreparably harmed"" because they will be deprived of their constitutional prerogative to draw the congressional map in their state, and the public interest will be disserved if the 2022 congressional elections in North Carolina are held using districts that the court eventually determines were ""unconstitutionally imposed.""Justice Brett Kavanaugh said he agreed with his conservative colleagues that the court should eventually take up the issue of the role of state courts. But he did not dissent and said he agreed with the majority in the case at hand to allow the maps to be used for the next election. ""This Court has repeatedly ruled that federal courts ordinarily should not alter state election laws in the period close to an election,"" Kavanaugh wrote.Pennsylvania district fightLawyers for the Republican voters in Pennsylvania had told the justices that ""relief is urgently needed"" because candidates are already campaigning for office under an ""unconstitutional map"" and the statutory deadline for obtaining the needed signatures on nomination petitions falls on Tuesday.Pennsylvania had 18 seats in the US House of Representatives, but the results of the 2020 census left it with one seat fewer due to population shifts. In January, the Republican-led General Assembly approved what the GOP voters argued was a ""reasonable non-gerrymandered map"" that would have created a 9-8 majority of Democratic-leaning congressional districts. A roadmap to the 2022 midterm electionsBut Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf vetoed the map, saying the General Assembly's action ""adopts a map selected by politicians to take advantage of the process and choose their own voters.""Separately, a group of litigants went to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania to impose a map that would have favored Democrats and likely created a 10-7 majority of Democratic-leaning districts. The state Supreme Court ultimately adopted the plan -- dubbed the ""Carter Plan.""  Lawyers for the commonwealth asked the court to reject Republicans' petition, arguing it amounted to an ""invitation to chaos"" by creating an at-large election.""Petitioners ask the Court to scrap the entire congressional map for Pennsylvania and to order the Commonwealth to hold statewide at-large congressional elections for the first time since the 18th Century,"" Joshua Matz, a lawyer for Pennsylvania, said in court papers.This story has been updated with further details and background."

The Supreme Court's decision effectively cements a huge story that has been under the radar for months now: Democrats are on track to emerge from the decennial redistricting process in FAR better shape than either party expected even a year ago. ""This ruling ensures the 2022 House map will be much less skewed towards Republicans than the current one (and perhaps not skewed towards Rs at all),"" tweeted Dave Wasserman, a nonpartisan redistricting expert and House editor at the Cook Political Report, on Monday night.Read More And Wasserman noted that the news could get even better -- if the Ohio Supreme Court invalidates a Republican plan, it could mean two to three more House seats for Democrats.  All of that follows on a new map unveiled by New York Democrats last month, which could result in a 22-4 Democratic advantage in the state's delegation. (The current split is 19 Democrats, 8 Republicans.) It's a remarkable upsetting of expectations. Heading into the once-a-decade redraw, the conventional wisdom was that Republicans would have a large edge in redistricting -- one they would use to further position themselves to win back the House in 2022. Wrote FiveThirtyEight, a political analysis and projection site, shortly after the 2020 election:  ""Joe Biden may have won the White House, but down-ballot races were much better for Republicans. In fact, the GOP's victories in state-level elections could pay dividends long after Biden leaves office, thanks to their influence over next year's redistricting process."" The disparity was stark. According to the Cook Political Report, Republicans had full control of the line-drawing process in 20 states that comprised 187 congressional districts, while Democrats had that same full control in just eight states with 75 districts total.So, what happened? The most aggressive Democratic gerrymanders -- like New York and Illinois -- appear to have withstood any potential legal challenges. The same can't be said for similarly over-the-top Republican gerrymanders in places like North Carolina. (For more on this, check out today's CITIZEN by CNN newsletter.)  In other states, deadlocks in the main body charged with drawing the lines handed power to a third-party entity, which favored Democrats. The most obvious and important example of that reality is in Pennsylvania. The state's Supreme Court, where Democrats hold a majority, took control of the line-drawing process last month after the Democratic governor and Republican-controlled legislature deadlocked on a map that must reduce the state's House delegation from 18 seats to 17 seats. The Point: Democrats are still underdogs in their quest to hold the House majority come November -- even with the unexpected redistricting boost. But the map looks less unfriendly to the party than even the biggest Democratic optimists could have imagined a year ago."

Ron DeSantis engaged in a high-stakes game of chicken over the state's new congressional map on Friday, with future control of the US House of Representatives potentially at stake.Over the objections of DeSantis, a Republican who publicly vowed to veto their work, the GOP-controlled House and Senate passed new congressional boundaries Friday that would reshape the political landscape in Florida for the next decade. In an unusual step, state lawmakers approved two maps: one that draws new boundaries to a more Republican advantage and one that is closer to the status quo. If the first map is not approved by the state Supreme Court, then the second safer map would be implemented. The maps now head to DeSantis' desk, where the governor made clear Friday on Twitter they were ""DOA.""""What makes you think when I say I'm going to do something that I'm not going to follow through?"" DeSantis said at a news conference in Jacksonville. ""I don't make declarations lightly.""""I don't bluff,"" he added.Read MoreThe House passed the maps 67-47, with some Republicans voting against the new boundaries. The Senate vote was 24-15.The showdown over the maps is a rare public power struggle between DeSantis and the Florida Legislature, which has almost always ceded to the governor and his agenda during his tenure in office.DeSantis has urged lawmakers in his party to get behind a much more partisan map, one that could give Republicans the advantage in at least 18 of the 28 districts in the state, and as many as 20. His insistence echoes similar calls from Republican operatives that want to see the GOP press its advantage in hopes of helping the party win a majority in the US House this fall.Florida Republicans currently hold 16 seats in the US House to 11 for the Democrats. The state gained a seat in redistricting and will have 28 House seats for the next decade.But Republican state lawmakers have stood by their work, insisting their maps are constitutionally sound.""The two-map solution is a creative solution that captures the feedback of all our stakeholders: the public, the members of this chamber and the Governor,"" said state Rep. Tyler Sirois, the chairman of the House Congressional Redistricting Subcommittee. DeSantis, meanwhile, has pushed for lawmakers to break up two of four Black-access districts in what Democrats say is a violation of the Voting Rights Act and the state's Fair District amendment to its constitution.State Sen. Janet Cruz, a Tampa Democrat, said the governor's threats to lawmakers were ""a stain in this whole process.""JUST WATCHED'Ridiculous': DeSantis lambasts students for wearing their masks ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'Ridiculous': DeSantis lambasts students for wearing their masks  00:51DeSantis has inserted himself into the state's once-in-a-decade redistricting process far more than any of his predecessors, even going so far as to submit his own maps for consideration. He has repeatedly said he would veto any map that does not reapportion Florida's 5th Congressional District, a Black plurality seat that stretches across north Florida to connect African American communities in Tallahassee and Jacksonville. The district is represented by Democratic Rep. Al Lawson, who is Black. DeSantis would also break up an Orlando-area district represented by Rep. Val Demings, who is also Black.DeSantis believes Lawson's district represents an unconstitutional gerrymander, even though it was approved by the state Supreme Court last decade.If DeSantis vetoes the maps, then the Legislature could override him with two-thirds of the vote. If state lawmakers cannot come to agreement on a map, then they could kick the fight to the state Supreme Court.Florida is one of four states that have yet to finalize their congressional maps."

""Back in 2012, after the last redistricting round, 66/435 districts went for [Barack] Obama or [John] McCain by five points or less.""That lack of competition is reflected in the ratings offered by nonpartisan handicapping services like the Cook Political Report. As of today, Cook rates just 13 House races as ""toss ups"" and another 17 as ""leaning"" towards one party. Inside Elections, another campaign tip sheet, currently lists a meager 11 House races as pure ""toss ups"" and 14 as either ""tilting"" or ""leaning"" towards one party. That marks a major change from even the 2020 election. According to Cook Political Report calculations, 42 Republicans and 40 Democrats won with 55% or less of the vote that year -- the traditional marker for competitiveness in congressional elections.It also continues a decades-long trend of declining competitiveness as a direct result of the redrawing of the country's 435 congressional districts.

That increasing lack of competitiveness has a clear impact on how the government works -- or, more accurately, doesn't. There is a direct connection between the increasing number of purely partisan districts and the decided dearth of bipartisanship in Congress. It creates a disincentive for candidates to do anything other than throw red meat to their bases as the way to win. And it keeps incumbents forever wary of ever working with anyone outside of their party, for fear of being cast as disloyal and losing in a primary.The incentivizing of pure partisans can be seen in the rise of the likes of Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz and Jim Jordan on the right, as well as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib on the left. These are some of the most prominent faces within their respective parties and each one represents a district that would never elect -- or even consider electing -- someone from the other party.Put simply: There are a series of reverberations from drawing congressional districts where only one party has any realistic chance to win. And none of them are good for what people keep telling pollsters they want -- both sides to work together to solve the big problems facing the country.If you want to change the way politics works, you have to change the people you elect. And increasingly, that decision is taken out of the voters' hands by the map-drawers who create hundreds of non-competitive districts at the start of every decade."

After lower courts ordered Alabama to redraw a congressional map that they found diluted the strength of Black voters, the state turned to the Supreme Court with aggressive arguments about the reach of the historic law. Alabama secured a 5-4 ruling on Monday night that will reinstate the disputed map for this year's election. The assertions by Alabama about the role race should play in redistricting are just one of several claims being made by states defending their maps in court that would scale back the scope of the Voting Rights Act --  as Republican-controlled states move to adopt new voting restrictions in key battlegrounds. Some of the GOP states' arguments appear to go beyond even what a 6-3 conservative court would be willing to sanction. At stake is the role that a provision of the law known as Section 2 will play in combating racially discriminatory maps going forward. The provision prohibits voting procedures ""not equally open to participation by members"" of a protected class, like racial minorities, and it has been used to strike down maps said to dilute the power of voters of colors. In response to lawsuits filed in various GOP-led states challenging their maps under Section 2, the states have made a litany of arguments that would limit the use of the Voting Rights Act in redistricting cases.""Republicans are in a mood where they want to throw mud at the wall,"" said Michael Li, a senior counsel for the Democracy Program at the liberal-leaning Brennan Center. Read MoreThe Supreme Court did not formally endorse Alabama's claims. Some justices said their votes were driven by how redrawing the map would disrupt Alabama's election planning.""The court took pains to say that this was not a ruling on the merits, so we will take them at their word,"" former Attorney General Eric Holder, now the head of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, told reporters Thursday. ""We will use Section 2 of the Act in other parts of the country."" Still, even the sole conservative justice to dissent from the move, Chief Justice John Roberts, referenced a ""wide range of uncertainties"" that have arisen in how courts should approach vote dilution claims brought under the Voting Rights Act.  Supreme Court rulings that soften the punch of the act in redistricting could decrease the number of representatives of color in Congress and state legislatures, legal experts say. However, some conservatives have argued that the political shifts in who is electing minority candidates -- with White voters helping to propel several people of color to Congress -- will minimize the impact of such a change in the law. ""This notion that somehow you have to have a majority Black district to elect a Black representative was probably substantially more true in 1965 than it is in 2022,"" said Jason Torchinsky, a Republican election lawyer. What role should race play in redistricting Voting Rights Act compliance? The arguments Alabama is making are focused on the technical process that courts use to review Voting Rights Act redistricting claims, but they get at the heart of how race should be used as a corrective under the law. If Alabama can convince the Supreme Court to turn away from race consciousness that has historically been deployed in Voting Rights Act vote dilution cases, it will make those cases more difficult for minority voters to bring.  ""This comes down to the question of the role of race in drawing districts,"" Ben Ginsberg, a former Republican redistricting lawyer, told CNN. Under a 1986 Supreme Court precedent in the case Thornburg v. Gingles, redistricting challenges brought under the Voting Rights Act must pass what's commonly known as the Gingles test to get courts to strike down a map. According to the test's first prong, the challengers must prove that there is a relatively compact community of minority voters that could be drawn into a minority-majority district. The second two prongs have to do with racial polarization in voting: Does the minority population vote in a politically cohesive way? And does the racial majority vote as a bloc to defeat the minority voters' preferred candidates? The Alabama dispute before the Supreme Court targets the first prong, by digging into a tension between Voting Rights Act compliance and the Supreme Court rulings limiting the use of race in redistricting under the Constitution.  ""The court has made clear that partisan gerrymanders are not justiciable,"" Ginsberg said, referring to the Supreme Court's 2019 decision that said federal courts had no role in policing partisan gerrymanders. ""If [the Alabama dispute] portends a race-blind Voting Rights Act, then that restraint on gerrymandering is gone. That would leave little but state law grounds to stop gerrymanderers from implementing their most creative thoughts."" Alabama says that under the Voting Rights Act, states should be required to draw majority-minority districts only in circumstances where a race-blind approach to redistricting would have produced those districts. That means challengers could not use race over other redistricting criteria to prove that the first prong of the Gingles test could be met. ""Alabama's proposal would turn the VRA into a race-blind statute that only looks into what this hypothetical race-blind process would produce,"" said Nicholas Stephanopoulos, a Harvard Law professor who specializes in election law. ""And so the consequence would be just substantially less minority representation in America."" The approach that Alabama is advocating ""seems to be reverse-engineered to try to make it harder for plaintiffs to win these cases,"" said Rick Hasen, an election law professor at University of California-Irvine. Should the Voting Rights Act apply in redistricting? While Alabama is making complicated arguments to the Supreme Court about the technical approach to complying with the Voting Rights Act, Texas is shooting at the moon with its claims about the act's reach. The Lone Star State signaled in briefs filed in the Justice Department's redistricting case that Texas will argue to the Supreme Court that Section 2 of the act should not apply in redistricting.  Texas already has Justice Clarence Thomas on its side with its claim, as he wrote in a 2017 concurrence and in other cases that he holds that view. That case was heard before former President Donald Trump's three appointees joined the court, so it is unclear whether any of them would join Thomas. Even if they did, that would still leave Texas one justice short of the five votes it would need for a ruling in favor such an argument. Part of what makes Texas' argument such a stretch is that it ignores the legislative history of the law, legal experts said. When Congress has renewed the Voting Rights Act in the past, its adjustments to Section 2 have been aimed at how courts should apply it in redistricting. ""If Justice Thomas was right that Section 2 was never intended to apply to redistricting, Congress certainly seemed to think otherwise every time it renewed the act and tweaked the redistricting standards,"" Hasen said. Can private parties bring Voting Right Act claims? A similarly radical argument being made by Texas is that the law does not confer a so-called private cause of action. Texas made the claim in response to the redistricting lawsuit it faces from private civil rights groups challenging its maps. Alabama made the claim as well in earlier stages of its case, but it has abandoned the argument in its appeal to the Supreme Court. If that argument, which was also floated by Georgia in Voting Rights Act redistricting challenges brought there, were endorsed, it would mean that private individuals -- who currently bring the bulk of Section 2 case -- would no longer be able to file such challenges, leaving the law's enforcement to civil suits brought by the Justice Department. Texas and Alabama pointed to a line from Justice Neil Gorsuch's concurrence in the Supreme Court's most recent Voting Rights Act case, where he, joined by Thomas, said it was an ""open question"" whether such a private cause of action exists. Legal experts are deeply skeptical that the argument could gain traction with other justices, given that courts -- up to the Supreme Court -- have routinely heard privately brought Section 2 cases, including the case that produced the Gingles test.""The idea that none of these lawsuits could ever have been brought because private plaintiffs can sue runs against, like literally, the entire history of Section 2,"" Stephanopoulos said. How should multi-ethnic coalitions configure into Voting Rights Act compliance? Unlike some of the other arguments put forward by GOP states, their claims about how multi-ethnic coalitions should be viewed under the Voting Rights Act would not require the Supreme Court to drastically shift its jurisprudence. States like Texas are arguing that their opponents' legal challenges should fail because the challengers are asking for minority-majority districts that would combine racial or ethnic minorities to reach a majority. Many lower courts have OK'd Voting Rights Act districts drawn with multi-ethnic coalitions, but some courts haven't. The Supreme Court hasn't yet confronted the question directly and if the justices rejected the use of multi-ethnic coalitions, the ""Supreme Court wouldn't have to adopt total outlier position,"" Stephanopoulos said.In the Texas case, the state is claiming that the Voting Rights Act does not require Texas to create a minority-majority district by combining Black and Hispanic voters, as the challengers are seeking to do in the state.The impact of such a ruling would be less extreme than one that embraced GOP states' more sweeping arguments. Coalition districts are already tough to assemble under the Voting Rights Act because, under the Gingles test, those different ethnic groups must exhibit shared political preferences. ""It's not like the court saying, 'You can't have the rainbow coalition,' would affect a lot of districts and would overturn existing understandings,"" Hasen said. ""I think there's just an uncertainty about that."""

""More work remains and any legislative redraw must reflect the full intent of this decision.""Allison Riggs, co-executive director of the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, and one of the lawyers challenging the maps, said in a statement that the ruling was ""an unequivocal win for North Carolina's Black voters who were most harmed by this extreme partisan gerrymander.""Republican state Sen.

But California will stand as a notable exception as the final maps drawn by an independent commission are expected to yield at least seven -- and as many as 10 -- competitive seats as well as a wild scramble for current House members to figure out what districts they will run in.CNN spoke to more than a dozen political strategists, redistricting experts and campaign aides from both parties as California's congressional maps were being revised and refined over the past few weeks to gather their perspectives on how the state's most competitive races are shaping up.The Golden State's redistricting commission approved final maps late Monday night, drawing a total of 52 districts -- one fewer than in the past because of slower population growth. Overall the map still favors Democrats, who hold 42 of the state's current congressional seats, compared to 11 held by Republicans. Independent redistricting panels aim to draw fairer maps but still invite controversyBut Republicans are bullish about their prospects for pickups in 2022 because of the difficult political climate Democrats are facing. In 2020, Republicans flipped four of the state's congressional districts, including the special election win of GOP Rep. Mike Garcia in the 25th District, which covers portions of northern Los Angeles County and is anchored by Santa Clarita. Republican strategist and redistricting expert Matt Rexroad said his assumption is that ""2022 is going to be a very good year for Republicans overall,"" but he noted the GOP may have a more uphill struggle with the new maps in the cycles that follow. ""There's several seats in here that I think are seats that Republicans might even be favored in in 2022, but I don't know how that would look in, like 2028, as they continue to change,"" he said. Read MoreCalifornia's independent commission largely ignored existing congressional lines and the home addresses of the state's politicians, which more partisan processes have been criticized for taking into account, as they created the new maps. After Monday night's initial vote, the commission plans to leave the maps untouched for several days for public review, before giving final approval to the new districts as soon as December 26 and turning the maps over to the secretary of state.But California's battlefield for the 2022 elections is still taking shape, with a complex game of musical chairs expected over the next few weeks. Recent iterations of the maps placed as many as three incumbents in the same district and some of them may leapfrog into different districts if it improves their odds of winning. Members of Congress are not required to reside in the districts where they run, although running outside of their home districts sometimes opens candidates up to attacks on the campaign trail. Democratic Rep. Karen Bass, who is running for Los Angeles mayor, is one of nearly two dozen House Democrats not running for reelection next year. Members of California's delegation account for four of the 23 retirements in the House Democratic Caucus so far, opening up some opportunities for newcomers. Rep. Karen Bass is leaving Congress to run for Los Angeles mayor. Other members heading for the exits include Reps. Lucille Roybal-Allard, who represents portions of south and east Los Angeles; Alan Lowenthal who represents Long Beach; and Jackie Speier, who represents southern San Francisco and San Mateo County. Sam Oh, a Republican strategist who is the general consultant for Orange County GOP Reps. Young Kim and Michelle Steel -- two members who won some of the toughest 2020 congressional races in California, predicted that there would be ""a lot of campaign calls over the holidays to discuss every possible option"" on both the Republican or Democratic sides. ""Each campaign will do their due diligence to ensure that whatever seat they run for gives them the best long-term viability,"" Oh said. ""They'll be polling, looking at demographic trends and having very interesting team discussions in the next couple of weeks here as people start announcing for seats.""A competitive field in Orange CountyCalifornia's redistricting commissioners made major changes to the highly competitive areas of Orange County that will affect the fortunes of Democratic Rep. Katie Porter, as well as Steel, Kim and the Democratic contenders who had been lining up to challenge them.Commissioners essentially drew Porter, Steel and former Rep. Harley Rouda -- the Democrat vying for a rematch with Steel -- into the same seat, creating a long coastal district that encompasses Seal Beach and Huntington Beach to the north, continuing south through Costa Mesa and Newport Beach to an area south of Laguna Beach, while folding in much of the Democratic-leaning city of Irvine, where Porter lives.Porter intends to run in that new 47th District and Democratic strategists view it as a solid opportunity for her given her popularity and huge war chest, and the fact that President Joe Biden won by double digits in that area. But in an unusually pointed statement Wednesday, Rouda said that the new coastal district includes 70% of the area that he represented while serving in Congress between 2018 and 2020 (before he was defeated by Steel). He added that he ""learned via Twitter that Representative Porter has left the district that includes 70% of her constituents, and is now running in my coastal district.""Rouda said he believes he is the ""most electable Democrat"" in that new district but said that he would spend the holidays with his family and ""evaluate all the options laid before us."" Porter campaign spokesperson Jordan Wong said she would be running in that district because it ""includes her home city of Irvine, where she lives, and where her three children attend public school."" But Wong hinted at challenges ahead, noting that ""roughly two-thirds of voters in the 47th District have not previously been represented by Congresswoman Porter"" and said ""she looks forward to introducing herself to these voters and running a positive and spirited campaign, as she did to win close races in 2018 and 2020.""Rexroad cautioned that no one should count out Republicans in that new district, noting that his analysis shows former Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox won just under 49% of the vote in that area in 2018 and that GOP candidates often overperformed former President Donald Trump in Orange County. Democratic Rep. Katie Porter intends to run in the new 47th District. Though Steel, a first-generation American who immigrated from South Korea as a young adult, lives in that coastal district, she announced Wednesday that she would run in a new Orange County district just to the north that looks more favorable to Republicans. That newly created 45th District encompasses much of Little Saigon, an area with a high concentration of Vietnamese voters where Steel campaigned heavily and did well in 2020.Several GOP strategists noted that Steel has built strong relationships with the diverse Asian communities in areas like Westminster and Garden Grove that are part of that new district and she has deep roots beyond her current district, because of her service on the California State Board of Equalization and as a member of the Orange County Board of Supervisors. Nearly 37% of the eligible voters in that district are Asian -- which is on the higher side for southern California -- creating a diverse battlefield for both parties.""Californians today are facing so many challenges -- from high taxes to concerns over affordability, crime, and the quality of education our children receive,"" Steel said in a statement Wednesday. ""Although the district lines have changed, my mission has not. I have spent my entire career as a public servant fighting to protect California taxpayers, to lower crime rates, and to hold government accountable when it fails the people, and I will continue to do that work.""Democrat Jay Chen, a small business owner and lieutenant commander in the US Naval Reserves who is one of the party's top recruits, had announced that he would challenge Kim. But he plans to run in the new 45th District, creating a highly competitive matchup with Steel.Kim's current 39th District -- which had encompassed pieces of Orange, Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties -- was also sliced and diced under the new lines. She announced Wednesday that she will run in a new, geographically larger inland Orange County district to the south and east, which looks as though it will be far more favorable to Republicans. That new 40th District includes communities that Kim currently represents like Yorba Linda and Chino Hills as well as a large swath of territory in Porter's current district, including parts of Orange and Tustin, continuing farther south through Laguna Hills, Mission Viejo and Rancho Margarita.""From day one, I have been committed to serving Southern California and that commitment does not change with updated district lines. The out-of-touch policies we see from Nancy Pelosi and Washington politicians are hurting our communities and I'll continue to fight to combat inflation, lower taxes on Californians, and bolster our national security,"" Kim said in a statement. A boost to Latino power in the Central Valley  Three of the most competitive seats in the Central Valley have been those held by Democratic Rep. Josh Harder and Republican Reps. David Valadao and Devin Nunes, who announced earlier this month that he is leaving Congress to head up Trump's social media venture. Under the new lines, territory that had been held by both Nunes and Democratic Rep. Jim Costa ended up in the new 21st District, which is more Democratic than Nunes' current seat. Costa announced Tuesday that he will run in that new seat.The commission made some dramatic changes to Harder's seat, essentially splitting it in two with a dividing line in and around the population center of Modesto, where Harder went to high school. But later in the process, the commission spent much of its time trying to boost the percentages of eligible Latino voters in three of the Central Valley districts to increase Latino influence in future elections in keeping with the Voting Rights Act. Democratic Rep. Josh Harder represents one of the most compeitive seats in the Central Valley under the existing map.During that process, Harder's fortunes improved as greater portions of Modesto were added back in to his district, which is the new 13th District. The competitive seat now runs farther south through the Central Valley, sweeping up large portions of Costa's district, which is making it unclear how they will sort out their home turf. Rexroad noted that there may also be an opportunity for the GOP in a newly created 9th District just to the north, which encompasses Stockton and San Joaquin county. Rob Pyers, research director with the California Target Book, a comprehensive guide to the state's political data, noted that the commission essentially moved many Republican voters in the Central Valley into the current district of House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy as they were boosting the influence of Latino voters in other districts, creating more difficult contests for some of McCarthy's neighboring Republicans in 2022.The consolidation of GOP areas made Valadao's district more competitive by a couple of points, Pyers said, by dismembering his Kings County home territory -- where his family farms alfalfa, almonds corn and wheat -- while splitting up the Republican vote in a number of towns and cities.""The seats objectively get worse for Republicans in the Central Valley versus 2020, but the national environment"" -- which favors the GOP -- ""could counteract that,"" Pyers said.Valadao, who lost his perennial swing seat to Democrat TJ Cox in 2018 and then won it back last year -- will face a tougher race in 2022, both because of the way the commission has drawn the new lines and because he is facing a strong challenge from Democrat Rudy Salas, a California assemblyman and former member of the Bakersfield City Council, as well as from several others.Redistricting commissioners shifted Valadao's district farther south from an area near Hanford -- where he was born and raised -- so that his new district encompasses less of the areas around Fresno and more of the bluer areas around Bakersfield. Allies of Salas hope that shift will give the Democratic challenger an edge since he is best known in the Bakersfield area.GOP Rep. David Valadao won his seat back in 2020 after being defeated in 2018. But Robert Jones, a Republican strategist who advises Valadao, said the congressman is not daunted by the challenge even if the district ends up looking more Democratic. He noted that Valadao won in 2020 in a district Biden won by about 10 points and has historically done better with Latino voters than other GOP candidates. ""The Hispanic communities are going to be put together in districts that are going to be really competitive (with voters) really evaluating candidates outside of party labels,"" Jones said. ""We win a good share of votes, and have cross-over votes, all over the district. There's no part of the district that we don't compete in, and if it goes a little bit in one direction or another from the current lines, I think we're going to be competitive.""Swing seats in northern Los Angeles and San Diego countiesThe redistricting commission also made some major changes to the Republican seat held by Garcia, a Santa Clarita native and former Navy fighter pilot. Garcia managed to flip California's current 25th District -- which Republicans had lost in 2018 -- back to the GOP in a 2020 special election after Democrat Katie Hill resigned from Congress amid controversy. Trump endorsed Garcia in that race. In 2022, Garcia is facing a rematch with Democrat Christy Smith, as well as a challenge from Democratic newcomer Quaye Quartey, a former Navy intelligence officer, among others. Smith, a former member of the state assembly, only lost to Garcia by 333 votes in the 2020 general election, underscoring the competitiveness of the area.Garcia faces some challenges under the new lines in what will now be the 27th District. The commission has removed conservative portions of the Simi Valley from his district and added bluer areas of the San Fernando Valley. Despite Garcia's conservative voting record, however, he has not shied away from running in areas that have typically been challenging for Republicans and political observers on both sides believe the seat will remain competitive.GOP Rep. Mike Garcia participates in a ceremonial swearing-in on Capitol Hill in 2020 after flipping a blue seat red in a special election.The most competitive seat in San Diego county will be the coastal district of Democratic Rep. Mike Levin, who also represents part of the southern Orange County coast. Though there were some territory swaps, the redistricting commission appears to have essentially maintained the status quo in San Diego County, preserving two Democratic seats in the city of San Diego and along the San Diego coast that are held by Democratic Reps. Sara Jacobs and Scott Peters, although their residences were drawn into the same district).Republican Rep. Darrell Issa's seat covering parts of East County, San Diego had looked more competitive at various points during the process, but now looks fairly safe for the GOP. A win for voters who sought competition Paul Mitchell, a redistricting expert with the Sacramento-based firm Redistricting Partners, said for all the complaints that have emerged with California's tedious process -- and the line-drawing that unfolded over hundreds over hours on videoconference -- the state's voters will at least have confidence that partisanship did not play a central role.When they passed two ballot measures to create the independent commission in 2008 and 2010, voters ""didn't want politicians drawing districts to advantage political parties and incumbents, and they've completely won in that regard,"" Mitchell said. ""None of this reflects where politicians want these lines to be drawn. None of this reflects where the political parties want these lines to be drawn.""""People might not like where their city is drawn with another city, or they might not like the political implications of the lines,"" he added. ""But they can't say that they don't know why a line was drawn where it was, because it's all done on video.""This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday."

Ron DeSantis. The House vote completes legislative action on the measure, which is now headed to DeSantis for his signature.The bill would establish an Office of Election Crimes and Security within the Department of State with a staff of 15 to conduct preliminary investigations of election fraud. In addition, the measure calls for DeSantis to appoint up to 10 law enforcement officers to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to probe election crimes.The combined effort would have a budget of about $3.7 million, said state Rep. Daniel Perez, the Republican lawmaker guiding the bill through the House.

It's currently a misdemeanor to do so. It also increases the fine from $1,000 to $50,000 on organizations that violate election registration laws.Critics said it was overreach.""We're going to convict people of a felony because they helped three instead of two elderly neighbors?"" Democratic state Rep.

""We don't know exactly what they are investigating: Are they investigating election officials? Are they investigating voters?""Democrats in the Florida House raised concerns during this week's debate that increased penalties could ensnare voter registration groups for making mistakes, such as misplacing a voter's registration card, and chill their activity in the state.Responded Perez: ""If the third-party voter organization doesn't commit fraud, they're never going to have to be concerned about paying fines or fees.""Cecile Scoon, the president of the Leagure of Women Voters of Florida, called the new $50,000 fine a ""direct threat"" to her organization. ""When you couple the increased fines with the new election investigators, it doesn't give you a warm or cozy feeling,"" she told CNN.The bill also mandates that election supervisors conduct maintenance of voter lists more frequently and expands a ban on private funding of election administration to include ""the cost of any litigation."""

""A record number of people cast their ballots in the 2020 elections. It was a triumph of democracy in many ways. But not everyone saw it that way. Some saw it as a threat,"" Harris said, lamenting the raft of what she called ""un-American"" laws enacted in GOP-led states across the country that make it more difficult to vote. The vice president said she and President Joe Biden ""have put the full power of the executive branch behind our shared effort"" while criticizing Republican lawmakers for voting to block passage of the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. ""If we all continue to work together, to march together, to fight together, we will secure the freedom to vote,"" Harris said. Harris advocated for filibuster reform in her remarks after Senate Democrats failed earlier this year to change filibuster rules to get around GOP opposition to advancing voting rights legislation.Read MoreShe called on those gathered at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge ""to continue to push the Senate to not allow an arcane rule to deny us the sacred right.""Bloody Sunday commemorates when, in 1965, 600 people began a march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, demanding an end to discrimination in voter registration. At the Edmund Pettus Bridge, state and local lawmen attacked the marchers with billy clubs and tear gas, driving them back to Selma. Seventeen people were hospitalized and dozens more were injured by police.Harris said Sunday that those who marched across the bridge in 1965 did so not only to ensure the right to vote, but ""to ensure all the people of our nation, no matter where they start, have the opportunity to succeed."" The vice president also met with civil rights leaders while in Alabama, according to the White House. She was joined by Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Marcia Fudge, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan, and Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs Donald Remy. At the top of her remarks, Harris made note of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, calling it ""a reminder that freedom and democracy can never be taken for granted, by any of us.""The first Black and first South Asian woman to hold the vice presidency, Harris has attended previous anniversary events in Selma. During virtual remarks at a commemoration service last year, she recalled joining the late Rep.

""I was with him on what would be his final walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. And I will hold that memory forever in my heart,"" Harris said at the time. Biden signed an executive order aimed at expanding voting access on last year's Bloody Sunday anniversary.During his State of the Union speech last Tuesday, the President reiterated his call for Congress to pass and send several key pieces of voting rights legislation to his desk to be signed into law, including the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The bill is aimed at fighting voter suppression and updating portions of the Voting Rights Act, which was signed into law in the summer of 1965, months after Bloody Sunday. However, despite the White House's efforts, Senate Democrats' failure to change the chamber's filibuster rules essentially dashed their hopes of passing any federal legislative interventions on voting rights before the 2022 midterm elections.This story has been updated on Sunday with remarks from Vice President Kamala Harris.

","politics, GOP redistricting battles in Alabama and other states raise concerns about voter suppression - CNNPolitics",'Devastating implications': GOP redistricting battles in Alabama and other states raise concerns about voter suppression,"(CNN)Kenya Goodson, a 46-year-old Black woman from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, has voted in every election since she was 19.  But last week's Supreme Court decision to allow Alabama's new congressional map -- which voting rights advocates say dilutes the power of Black voters -- to remain in place has left Goodson, who volunteers to register voters, discouraged about casting a ballot herself. ""I was really very hurt, you know, and angry really by the decision by our Supreme Court,"" said Goodson, an adjunct professor at the University of Montevallo. ""There are people that are making decisions, not because it's the law, but they're making decisions to uphold White supremacy by diluting my vote."" ""It is discouraging because I don't know what I could do as a citizen to change anything,"" she added.  Kenya Goodson registers voter and assists with the Census count at the Government Plaza in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.Legal challenges are expected to continue in this case, and similar lawsuits have been filed in Texas and Georgia, which will bring the issue of voting rights, racial gerrymandering and discriminatory election practices to the forefront ahead of the midterm elections. Read MoreThe Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments over the Alabama map, which could determine the fate of the landmark Voting Rights Act.Goodson said she is still going to vote, and will encourage others to do so, because ""our ancestors ... helped us to get this right,"" but community organizers worry there could be ""devastating implications"" that marginalize Black voters and could, in turn, impact turnout and faith in the democratic process.  LaTosha Brown, an Alabama native and founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, said this ruling is ""really rubber-stamping voter disenfranchisement."" ""But it's not just about Alabama,"" Brown added. ""It has implications for voter protections around the country."" What is redistricting?Felicia Scalzetti, a redistricting organizer for the Alabama Election Protection Network and the Ordinary People Society, told CNN, ""The problem with redistricting is that ... it changes who you can vote for.""  ""You can encourage people to turn out all you want,"" Scalzetti said. ""But if the slate of people on the ballot do not actually represent your community because your community is cut six ways to Sunday, there's no amount of turning out that's going to fix that.""  Redistricting is the process of reallocating congressional seats every 10 years based on population changes reflected in the US Census and then redrawing the boundaries of the congressional districts so each has an equal population.  In 35 states, the legislature has control over the redistricting process, which raises concerns about the incumbent party manipulating the process in its favor, also known as partisan gerrymandering. In this election cycle, 20 of the 35 states are controlled by Republicans, compared with 11 favoring Democrats, according to the Pew Research Center. Four states have divided governments.  'They know where Black voters live': Challengers say 'race blind' redistricting maps are anything butSimilarly, redrawing in terms of race is known as racial gerrymandering. Since voters of color tend to favor Democrats, redistricting driven by party interests or fueled by racial motivation -- whether to curb voters of color or amplify their influence -- go hand in hand.  Alabama's Republican-drawn map gives Black voters the majority in only one of seven districts despite them making up 27% of the population. Thus, the Alabama lawsuit argued that it had been drawn based on race, and used the ""cracking"" and ""packing"" tactics to specifically dilute the power of Black voters.  The map lumped areas with high concentrations of Black people together in one district where they could be the majority -- known as packing -- and split up other Black voters in the state so they remain a minority in all other districts -- known as cracking. It will remain in place for the state's primaries in May. 

""The thinking that we could just disenfranchise people at the state level is still here and it still operates a large part of the state's attitude toward our voting structure,"" Dev Wakeley, policy analyst at Alabama Arise, a nonprofit public policy advocacy organization, told CNN.Wakeley and others say the map is a violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits any practice that denies or curtails the right to vote based on race. The law included a provision that mandated states with a history of discriminatory practices, which included Alabama, to obtain federal approval before changing electoral practices, but it was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013.  In fact, a lower court unanimously ruled that the new congressional map violates the Voting Rights Act, and the three-judge panel -- which included two judges appointed by former President Donald Trump -- ordered the state to draw another district where Blacks made up a majority of voters or close to it.  What the Supreme Court's decision on Alabama's maps could mean for the Voting Rights Act""No one had any faith that the state of Alabama was going to have voters' best interests at heart,"" Wakeley said. ""We expected a little more of an attempt at a fig leaf by the Supreme Court.""  But with a conservative majority and in a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court allowed the new map to stay in place while the case plays out, and experts say the highest court's decision ""sends a very strong signal.""  David Canon, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who focuses on redistricting, told CNN, ""It'll be harder for states to follow what we thought was settled law when it comes to creating minority-majority districts or even influence districts.""  ""It's going to be more of an uphill climb now for anyone to win a voting rights challenge,"" he added. Similar battles nationwide ""The sort of anti-democratic ideas that have infested a lot of Alabama decision makers are much more widespread,"" Wakeley said.  ""While we might be the sort of sandbox where these terrible policies come into play,"" he added, ""we're far from alone.""  Other states have also been accused of intentionally suppressing the vote of communities of color in their redistricting plans.  A short history of the long conservative assault on Black voting powerMark Gaber, who litigates redistricting cases for the Campaign Legal Center, told CNN, ""It just seems, you know, that wherever the folks in power want to retain their power, they'll, you know, have no sort of shame about violating voting rights of minorities."" The Campaign Legal Center is a non-profit legal advocacy organization that has filed lawsuits against multiple states for racial and partisan gerrymandering.  Texas faces multiple lawsuits, including one filed by the Biden administration in December, for its congressional map, which the Justice Department says does not reflect the state's growth in minority population.  The state was awarded two additional congressional seats due to minority communities, who made up 95% of the state's overall population growth, but the Justice Department said Texas had drawn the map in a way that the two new seats would be decided by  majority-White voting populations.  The Southern Poverty Law Center filed a lawsuit against Georgia last month on behalf of multiple advocacy groups, saying the state's new congressional map is ""its latest assault on the rights of Black voters and other voters of color to participate meaningfully in the democratic process and elect candidates of their choice.""The lawsuit alleges that Georgia, similarly to Alabama, packed voters of color into one district and spread out remaining voters of color to ensure they are the voting minority in two other districts.  ""We're in a very sort of unstable time in this landscape of voting rights law, and also just generally about elections in the country,"" Gaber said. ""And I think the last decade of experience in America proves that now more than ever we need protections for Black and Latino voters."""

It's a slimmed-down version of an elections police force sought by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.Keep in mind: There's no evidence that widespread fraud tainted the results of the 2020 election in Florida -- a state former President Donald Trump won handily. But Trump's supporters in the Sunshine State have clamored for GOP officials to investigate his falsehoods about election fraud.Similar ideas for election police units have cropped up from Trump allies in Arizona and Georgia.Other states to watchBills under consideration in Arizona would prohibit the use of unmonitored ballot drop boxes, require additional identification to vote and mandate that the state auditor general carry out ""election integrity audits"" of county election operations.Arizona, a state that flipped blue in the 2020 presidential election, has been at the red-hot center of battles over voting. The GOP-led Senate last year authorized a widely panned ""audit"" of the election results in Maricopa County that failed to uncover fraud. This year, the battleground state will host one of the marquee Senate races of the midterms as Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly seeks reelection.But one controversial bill that would have empowered the legislature to reject election results was effectively killed last week after a bit of parliamentary maneuvering by the House Speaker Rusty Bowers, a Republican.In another political battleground, a Pennsylvania state court recently struck down as unconstitutional an election law that allowed no-excuse mail-in voting.

Rusty Bowers, but the Arizona House speaker has quietly made a name for himself in the state as the stealth killer of his party's most extreme election ideas.First up was a bill that would have ripped up most voting rules in this battleground state and handed the state legislature the power to reject election results it didn't like. In a bit of parliamentary jiu jitsu, Bowers assigned the bill to 12 committees at once, ensuring it would go nowhere. Its sponsor, GOP state Rep. John Fillmore, called it a ""12-committee lynching.""Arizona Mirror journalist Jeremy Duda offered a colorful take -- describing Bowers' takedown as ""killing the bill, chopping it up, setting the pieces on fire, then digging up the ashes and throwing them into the ocean.""Read MoreThen came Rep. Mark Finchem's resolution this month on Arizona's 2020 election results. Finchem, a Republican running for secretary of state this year with Trump's endorsement, makes mostly debunked claims of fraud to call for the results to be set aside in three counties. It includes Maricopa, the state's most populous county, targeted last year in a problem-plagued ballot review ordered by Republicans in the state Senate.Bowers' response to the proposal, per The Arizona Republic: ""Mr. Finchem's obviously unconstitutional and profoundly unwise proposal will receive all of the consideration it deserves.""Bowers, a professional painter and sculptor who represents a district east of Phoenix, has a contrarian history -- at least when it comes to some of his party's most outlandish maneuvers in recent years.He has described Trump and the then-President's lawyer Rudy Giuliani calling him after the 2020 election, asking Bowers to somehow inject the legislature into the certification process before the state sent its slate of 11 presidential electors to Congress.Bowers told CNN's Dianne Gallagher that he voted and campaigned for Trump but rebuffed that. ""I said, 'No, I won't,'"" Bowers recounted in a CNN interview last year, adding, ""'3.5 million people voted here, I'm not gonna unilaterally do that.'""Bowers is term-limited in the Arizona House, and last week announced plans to run for the state Senate.Arizona at ground zeroEven as headline-grabbing election bills falter in Arizona, Republican lawmakers still are weighing a raft of proposals that could alter voting practices in a battleground state that President Joe Biden won by fewer than 11,000 votes.They include bills that would:Allow a third-party to scour the voter registration database for ineligible votersMake it a crime to misplace a ballotRestrict the use of ballot drop boxesMake it a felony for a public official to register someone to vote on the same day as election dayCreate a new election integrity unit to investigate voter fraudA database maintained by the National Conference of State Legislatures shows that Arizona accounts for nearly 10% of all the election-related bills in states this year.Alex Gulotta, a voting rights activist who runs the Arizona branch of All Voting is Local, said he credits Bowers with ""holding the line"" to block some of the most blatantly undemocratic ideas floated in the state.But, he said, ""there are actually a lot of bad things"" moving through the legislature ""that people are being silent about.""Dates to watchThe stakes are high in Arizona this year.Voters will fill an open gubernatorial seat, now held by term-limited Republican Gov.

Lawmakers in 12 states have already introduced or pre-filed 96 bills that would make changes to voting laws for the 2022 session, according to an analysis from the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's law school. That represents a 39% increase in bills from the same time last year, a sign that legislators have not let up on their efforts ahead of the midterms. The bills are part of a concerted effort by Republicans nationwide, who continue to cling to false claims about voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election to clamp down on access to the ballot box. ""It demonstrates that the trend of this being sort of a hot button and top political issue in state legislatures is continuing. And also gives us reason to worry that the passage of these new restrictive laws may also continue,"" said Sean Morales-Doyle, acting director of voting rights and elections at Brennan. Of the total bills this year, more than half aim to make changes to mail-in voting, an option that became popular amid the pandemic as election officials balanced health precautions with ballot access. The bills also deal with increasing or imposing voter ID requirements for in-person voting and registration. Virginia is leading the push this year, with 34 pre-filed or introduced bills as of mid-January. Last year it was one of a handful of states that moved to expand access to voting, including restoring voting rights to 69,000 former felons, under its then-Democratically controlled state legislature and then-Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat.Read MoreBut in November, Republicans took back the state House and the executive office, a move that has since led to dozens of voting-related bills being proposed. Additionally, 13 states have pre-filed and introduced 41 bills that undermine the electoral process, according to Brennan. This includes bills like one in Arizona that would have given the state legislature the power to reject election results. The extreme measure was effectively killed last week by Republican state House Speaker Rusty Bowers. And, Brennan says, 16 bills have been introduced in eight states that would impose new criminal or civil penalties on election officials for making unintended errors, a trend that some critics of the legislation argue is leading to officials leaving their positions. Morales-Doyle said it's early in the year and more bills could still be introduced as legislative sessions progress, but that because of this year's elections, the bills could have more of a partisan motivation. ""It could be that there's a lot of political reasons why a legislature might want to introduce a restrictive bill and sponsor it. But that doesn't mean that the bill is going to go anywhere,"" Morales-Doyle told CNN on Wednesday. ""There's more this year than there were last year so we at least have reason to be concerned about what might happen next."""

New restrictions contemplated in other states this year could bring another wave of changes ahead of the midterm elections.Texas' early voting -- which kicked off Monday for US congressional seats, governor and six other statewide offices -- positioned the state as one of the first to test the new laws, and as CNN reported, it has already left election officials and voters grappling with its requirements.Read MoreThe Texas law imposes a raft of changes in a state that already had some of the strictest voting regulations in the country.Among its provisions, the law establishes ID requirements to vote absentee and makes it a crime for a public official to mail absentee ballot applications to voters who haven't requested them.

The justices announced they would revisit a key section of the landmark law in upcoming months and in a 5-4 vote reinstated an Alabama congressional map that a lower court found had diluted the voting power of Blacks in the state. Led by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court's conservative majority in 2013 eviscerated a key section of the Voting Rights Act that required states with a history of discrimination to obtain federal approval before changing election rules.Supreme Court lets GOP-drawn Alabama congressional map that critics say dilutes power of Black voters stay in placeThe new controversy could lead to a further hollowing out of a separate provision -- known as Section 2 and barring practices that racially discriminate -- specifically in the context of redistricting maps. Combined, the court's actions could mean the reach of the Voting Rights Act is dramatically limited by the 2024 presidential election. Read MoreThis latest voting rights controversy arises against a broader erosion in America of democratic norms and a polarized electorate. States have increasingly adopted new restrictions for the polls, and federal legislation to safeguard voting rights has stalled in Congress. The conservatives who control today's court have consistently enhanced states' control over election practices, while diminishing opportunities for federal oversight and judicial safeguards. In a case from Arizona last year, the justices narrowed the reach of Section 2 as they upheld policies requiring ballots cast by people at the wrong precinct to be wholly discarded and criminalizing third-party collection of absentee ballots, such as at nursing homes. The three liberal justices dissented Monday and warned that if the Supreme Court fully accepts Alabama's legal rationale for opposing a second majority-Black district in the state, it ""would rewrite decades of this Court's precedent"" that has given racial minorities an equal opportunity to participate in elections. Alabama's population is 27% Black, and the state legislature created a map that would provide Blacks the opportunity to elect their preferred candidate in only one of the state's seven congressional districts.  By allowing the state to use that map, Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her dissent, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, the court ""does a disservice to Black Alabamians who under that precedent have had their electoral power diminished -- in violation of a law this Court once knew to buttress all of American democracy."" The surprising liberal consensus emerging about Biden's Supreme Court decisionThe court's acceptance of the Alabama dispute means the justices will begin the 2022-23 session next October with two racially charged controversies on its agenda. The justices recently announced they would hear lawsuits against race-based affirmative action practices at Harvard and the University of North Carolina. RELATED: The 3 Supreme Court justices to watch after Breyer retiresToday's Supreme Court majority is plainly exerting its right-wing muscle with three new appointees of former President Donald Trump. In the current 2021-22 session that will run through June, the court already has signaled a willingness to plow through precedent related to abortion rights, gun control and religious liberties. A test of the Clean Air Act will be heard later this month as well. Voting rights pattern under Roberts The scope of the historic Voting Rights Act has been a recurring agenda item for the high court under Roberts' leadership.   In earlier decades, the high court upheld the sweep of the law, passed by Congress in the wake of the ""Bloody Sunday"" violence in Alabama. On March 7, 1965, state troopers with clubs and bullwhips attacked civil rights demonstrators crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. In a significant departure from prior court rulings, the justices in 2013 ended the VRA Section 5 requirement that states and other localities with a history of race discrimination obtain federal approval for any electoral changes. Taking the lead for a 5-4 majority, Roberts wrote that the problems that so-called Section 5 was designed to correct no longer existed. The 3 Supreme Court justices to watch after Breyer retires ""Our country has changed,"" Roberts wrote. That 5-4 decision in Shelby County v. Holder left intact Section 2, related to direct government discrimination, but the majority now appears poised to curtail its coverage in redistricting. Monday's paired cases, Merrill v. Milligan and Merrill v. Caster, involved Section 2 challenges to a congressional map drawn by the Republican-controlled state legislature. After Black voters and civil rights advocates challenged the seven-district congressional map as discriminatory, a US three-judge district court ruled that it diluted the votes of the Black votes under Section 2's prohibition on practices that deny a person the right to vote on account of race. The three-judge court said a second majority-Black district was possible, based on traditional redistricting criteria tied to the size of a population and their geographical compactness. The judges concluded in their decision that, ""under the totality of the circumstances, including the factors that the Supreme Court has instructed us to consider, Black voters have less opportunity than other Alabamians to elect candidates of their choice to Congress."" New York completes congressional redistricting, likely netting Democrats several seatsAs the Supreme Court on Monday restored the original map with only one Black-majority district and agreed to hear the legal merits of the case next session, the majority declined to explain its rationale. Roberts separately dissented, saying he believed the lower court's map, and a second-Black majority district, should have permitted for the 2022 election cycle while the justices resolved the larger questions and set standards for future elections. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh, joined by Justice Samuel Alito, wrote a concurring statement saying he believed it was too close to the upcoming midterm congressional elections in Alabama to replace the legislature's map. He warned of possible ""chaos and confusion"" leading up to the May primary and November general election. Also in the majority were Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett. Regarding the timing of the case, Kagan countered for the three liberal dissenters, ""Alabama is not entitled to keep violating Black Alabamians' voting rights just because the court's order came down in the first month of an election year.""  In his dissent, Roberts referred to the comprehensive lower court decision: ""In my view,"" he wrote, ""the District Court properly applied existing law in an extensive opinion with no apparent errors for our correction."" Based on the standards of a 1986 case, Roberts said, the Blacks and advocacy groups challenging the Alabama map demonstrated the need for the second Black-majority district. But Roberts also said that the 1986 precedent governing the dispute, Thornburg v. Gingles, and related rulings ""have engendered considerable disagreement and uncertainty regarding the nature and contours of a vote dilution claim."" As a result, Roberts endorsed the majority's decision to hear the Alabama controversy. ""(S)ubsequent elections,"" the chief justice wrote, ""would be governed"" by the Court's final decision in the dispute, likely to handed down in 2023. Alabama state lawyers have advocated for a greater use of race-neutral criteria in redistricting. Kagan and the other liberal dissenters said their arguments were ""premised on an entirely new view of what the law requires"" and would likely lead to fewer districts where minority voters are able to elect their preferred candidates. Takeaways from the $2.3 million Ruth Bader Ginsburg library auction""The District Court here did everything right under the law existing today,"" she continued. ""Staying its decision forces Black Alabamians to suffer what under that law is clear vote dilution.""  On the special US district court that ruled on January 24 in the case were US appellate Judge Stanley Marcus, appointed by President Bill Clinton, and US District Court Judges Anna Manasco and Terry Moorer, appointed by President Donald Trump. In concluding that Blacks merited a second majority-Black congressional district because of their population and location, the judges also took account of another element for a Section 2 violation, ""that voting in the challenged districts is intensely racially polarized."" ""This,"" the judges added, ""is not genuinely in dispute."""

Pretty much every single indicator that pointed to a Democratic wave in the 2018 midterms now points to a Republican one in the 2022 midterms.","politics, Why the 2022 midterm elections look like the opposite of 2018 - CNNPolitics",Why the 2022 midterms look like the opposite of 2018,"(CNN)What a difference four years makes in politics. At this point in 2017, Democrats were about to pull off a stunning Senate win against a very flawed opponent in the deeply red state of Alabama. It was one of many indications that Democrats were on their way to a big 2018 victory.Today, everything is different. Pretty much every single indicator that pointed to a Democratic wave in the 2018 midterms now points to a Republican one in the 2022 midterms.Here are some of those key factors to compare:Generic Congressional BallotStart with the fact that Democrats were up by about nine points in polling for the race for Congress in early December 2017. As it turned out, this was the margin by which they'd win the national House vote in November 2018. Read MoreThe Republicans hold an average two-point advantage on the generic ballot in December 2021. There have only been two midterm cycles since 1938 when Republicans had any lead on this measure at this point. One of those was 2002, when Republicans defied midterm history to gain House seats in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and very high approval ratings for President George W. Bush. The other was 2010 when they were up by two points on the generic ballot at this moment in time and went on to net gain 63 seats. Indeed, there have been ten times since 1938 when the opposition party (i.e. not in control of the presidency) led on the generic ballot this far from a midterm. They would go on to win a majority of seats in the midterm all ten of those times. Presidential Approval A big reason Republicans were struggling in December 2017 was that then-President Donald Trump's average approval rating was at a meager 37%. It was the worst for an elected president about 11 months into his first term.President Joe Biden is not much better with an approval rating of about 42%. His is the second worst approval rating for an elected president at this point in their first term.Neither president was anywhere close to where a president's ratings have been 13 months from the midterms in cycles in which his party gained or lost less than five seats in the House. (Republicans need a net pick up of at least five seats to gain control of the House.)The president's approval rating was between 60% and 84% at this point the three times (1962 cycle, 1998 cycle and 2002 cycle) in the polling era there was this minimal loss or gain for the president's party in a midterm election. Special Elections and Virginia Along with the polling, the special elections similarly point to a very different political environment from 2017. In more than 70 special state legislative and federal special elections through this point in the Trump presidency, Democratic candidates were doing an average of about 10 points better at this time than the 2016 presidential margin in that district or state was.Right now in 2021, Republicans are doing about five points better on average than the 2020 presidential margin in an average of nearly 60 special state legislative and federal special elections during the Biden presidency. While we still have a ways to go until the midterms, we know that the shift from the presidential baseline in special elections has been predictive of the next election. This has been true in midterms since 1994, and a lack of a major change from the 2016 baseline during the special elections in the lead up to 2020 was a major red flag that Republicans weren't as in much trouble as some of the polling indicated. Beyond the special elections, Democrats also did more than 3.5 points better than the 2016 presidential margin in the regularly scheduled 2017 Virginia elections. This was true both in the gubernatorial race and an average of 100 House of Delegate races. Last month, Republicans did over 12 points better than the 2020 presidential margin in the gubernatorial and an average of the 100 House of Delegate races. In doing so, they swept the top of the ticket (governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general) and gained control of the House of Delegates.House RetirementsThe results and polling are a big reason that politicians have or did run for the hills. More than a dozen Republican House members announced they were retiring from public office by early December 2017. Only five Democrats were. Today, 11 House Democrats are retiring from public office at the end of the Congress. Just four Republicans are (excluding Rep. Devin Nunes, who is resigning). Looking at all retirements (including those running for other elected offices, but excluding resignations), 19 Democrats are leaving the House compared to 11 Republicans at the end of the this Congress. In December 2017, it was 23 Republicans to 13 Democrats retiring at the end of that Congress. Retirements are not a perfect indicator of future midterm outcomes, but they're a sign. Elected officials are looking at the same statistics we are. They aren't likely to retire en masse, unless they sense they're going to lose power. That's why the party that has had more elected officials retiring from public office has lost seats in eight of the last 12 midterm cycles since 1974. The Bottom LineThe opposition party has picked up 5 or more seats in 34 of 38 midterms since 1870. Not a lot so far suggests that the 2022 midterms will be any different."

Kathleen Rice became the 30th Democrat to announce plans to not seek re-election in 2022. By comparison, only 13 House Republicans are planning to call it quits or seek higher office.""I entered public service 30 years ago and never left,"" said Rice of her decision. ""I have always believed that holding political office is neither a destiny nor a right. As elected officials, we must give all we have and then know when it is time to allow others to serve.""The 30 House Democratic retirements are the most for the party since 1992, when a whopping 41(!) Democrats walked away from their seats. If one more House Democrat retires before the election, the 2022 cycle will tie the 1976 and 1978 election cycles as the second most retirements in modern history for the party, with 31. Democrats have already seen more retirements in this cycle than the last two elections combined. Amy Walter, the editor of the Cook Political Report, a non-partisan campaign tip sheet, cites three main reasons for the Democratic exodus. First, she told me the national environment; ""it's bad out there for Democrats,"" she said. Second, the weight of history; ""they all know that it's hard for party in White House to pick up seats. They can only afford to lose 5. They can do math."" And, finally the ""environment"" in the Capitol itself; ""Talk to any member or staffer and they'll tell you morale is low. It's a combination of January 6th, a lack of civility, plus a frustration with a fact that most legislation is leadership driven instead of member driven.""Read More

""I think it's a direct result of the malaise on Capitol Hill,"" said former New York Rep. Steve Israel, who previously ran the party's House campaign committee. ""Most Members decide to retire when they calculate that they might lose their next election. These days people are deciding to retire when they're confident they will win.""Regardless of the reasons, the reality is that this rate of Democratic retirements begins to feed on itself at some point. If you are a Democratic member on the fence about running again and see a number of your colleagues deciding to end their political careers, that has to impact your own thinking. The more retirements there are, the easier it is for any one member to walk away. And that sort of snowball effect is what we've seen in recent weeks, with Democratic retirements coming hot and heavy.The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022And we know from history that open seats -- those without an incumbent running -- are more likely to flip parties than seats where the incumbent is seeking re-election.There is a solid -- if not perfect -- correlation between high retirement levels and House seat losses. In 1992, for example, Republicans netted 10 House seats in the general election, according to Brookings' Vital Statistics on Congress. In 1978, the Republican gain was 15. In 1976, however, Democrats actually gained a seat despite the 31 retirements from within their ranks.Democrats' issues are compounded by the fact that Republicans have kept their own retirements very low. If no other House Republican walks away this year, the 13 calling it quits will be the party's lowest total since 1988. Add it up and you see LOTS of Democratic vulnerability and very little Republican danger.According to the Cook Political Report's rankings, there are 38 competitive Democratic-held seats compared to just 19 Republican-held seats. With the House Democratic majority so thin, that disparity in competitive seats is a very ominous omen for Democrats' chances this fall.The simple fact is this: Democrats see the writing on the wall. Many are opting to retire rather than either lose a reelection bid or become a member of the minority party in the House in January 2023. And that is causing a vicious cycle that further narrows Democrats' chances this November."

And every week or so, when another Democratic member of Congress announces they won't run for reelection in 2022, the mood inside the caucus worsens.Morale in the House is already markedly low, but as Democrats look ahead to what could become a trying midterm election cycle, the overwhelming belief is that the wave of retirements has yet to crash.That was captured on Monday when two Democratic members announced they would not seek reelection in November.The Democratic retirement floodgates just burst openFirst was Florida Rep. Stephanie Murphy, who announced she would not seek reelection after three terms in the House. She stated that her time in office was both ""the honor of my life"" and ""incredibly challenging for my family and me,"" but her decision comes as the Republican-led legislature in Florida has taken interest in redrawing the district she represents, a move that would have made it harder for the Democrat to hold onto the Orlando-area seat.Then came California Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, who said in a statement Monday night that ""after thirty years in the House of Representatives, the time has come for me to spend more time with my family.""Read MoreAnd then on Tuesday morning, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi confirmed New Jersey Democratic Rep. Albio Sires would also retire.So far, 23 members of the House Democratic Caucus have announced they will not seek reelection. While it is common for the party in control to see a series of high-profile retirements ahead of a difficult midterm cycle, the sentiment inside the caucus is that even more departures are likely. A combination of political winds tilting toward Republicans, redistricting boxing some members out of easier races and an overall low morale among House members could lead to even more retirements in the coming months.""We have got a problem here,"" retiring Rep. Cheri Bustos said of the general morale inside the House. ""There are way too many people serving as members of Congress right now who I not only don't look up to, I have zero respect for. And I'm saddened to have to say that.""Bustos, who was first elected in 2012 and represents western Illinois, announced she was retiring earlier in the year and told CNN that she was looking for ""a new chapter in her life."" But it's clear that the current standing of Congress loomed over the decision. Bustos said that while she believes some Democrats aren't ""team players"" -- she did not name names -- the bulk of her concerns are with Republicans, and the prospect of turning over power to the GOP in 2022 is disturbing for all Democrats in Congress.""When you've only got a three- or four-vote majority and you see people who are in tough districts announcing that they're not running for reelection, yeah, everybody worries about what's ahead,"" said Bustos, the former chair of House Democrats' campaign arm.Republicans have also had some noteworthy retirements. Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, the top Republican on the powerful Ways and Means Committee, announced earlier this year that he would not run for reelection, and California Rep. Devin Nunes announced last week that he would be leaving the House to become CEO of the Trump Media & Technology Group.Pelosi will stay around to lead House Democrats through the next election -- and perhaps beyondBut retirements are a problem Democrats, as the party in power, particularly can't afford. The party has a slim majority in the House and with polls showing Republicans are overall in a better position to win congressional races next year, any slight change -- like an unexpected retirement in a swing seat -- could prove costly.Democratic members are aware of the party's current standing on the generic ballot, a survey question that asks respondents if they would be more likely to vote for Democrats or Republicans and often serves as a leading indicator of who will do better in the subsequent midterms. The fear is that members considering retirement may factor in those polls as they finalize their decision in the coming weeks.The bigger issue, according to Jesse Ferguson, a veteran Democratic operative who previously worked at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, is that retirements ""absolutely effect the psyche of the caucus"" because members who are staying ""evaluate these retirements based on their frame of reference inside the caucus, not based on the political implications of this open seat in the midterms.""'A 2010 kind of problem'Retirements pose a problem for the party in power because time and money are finite resources, and retirements in competitive seats often require the party to expend both in a race they had not anticipated. First, the party must help recruit a candidate in the district, hoping to do whatever they can to make up for the name recognition that the retiring incumbent had. Second, the party's campaign committees will have to spend money for that candidate -- a figure that is almost always significantly more than they would have spent on an incumbent.And Democratic retirements are stacking up.Earlier this month, Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon announced he would not seek reelection, leaving behind his powerful chairmanship of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.Earlier this year, Texas Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson announced she would not seek reelection, departing her role as chair of the Space, Science and Technology Committee. And Kentucky Rep. John Yarmuth, chair of the Budget Committee, also said he won't see reelection in 2022.'A 50-50 Senate sucks': Dejected Democrats fret over agenda failure amid grim 2022 outlook But the problem extends far beyond powerful committee chairs and includes some districts that will be difficult for Democrats to hold in a tough year.Wisconsin Rep. Ron Kind, one of few Democrats who represents a district that voted for former President Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020, announced earlier this year he wouldn't run again, opening a seat in an area Republicans are confident they could win. Arizona Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick was the first congressional Democrat to announce she would not seek reelection in March, vacating the Arizona's 2nd Congressional District, which was represented by a Republican before she won in 2018. And New York Rep. Tom Suozzi recently announced he would run for governor and not seek reelection in his Long Island district, which could be competitive if Democrats face a particularly difficult cycle.Each retirement has been cheered by Republicans.""Every Democratic retirement demoralizes their party further and forces Democrats to spend precious resources defending competitive seats,"" said Michael McAdams, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. ""No one wants to run as a House Democrat this cycle.""So far, Democratic leaders -- at least publicly -- are rejecting the idea that Democrats have a retirement problem.""It's pretty standard stuff,"" Sean Patrick Maloney, the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told CNN's Manu Raju. ""Anybody who serves in this Congress knows that these are personal decisions. No, I'm not that worried about it. I think the Republicans are still going to have to have at least one good idea for America. They can't do it with tricks and stacking the deck.""Democrats walk on eggshells around Breyer as GOP plans another blockade for any Biden Supreme Court pickBut there is a sense inside the caucus that things have not been as rosy as Maloney and others would like people to believe.Rep. Filemón Vela, a Texas Democrat who announced earlier in the year that he would not seek reelection, said he is confident the party will do fine in the midterms ""if we've got control of inflation and Covid by the summer of next year.""""I'm not going to say we keep the majority because it is tight both ways,"" he said. ""But if next November comes around and we're still in the middle of the Covid crisis and inflation is through the roof then, yeah, we've got a big problem.""After a pause, Vela -- who said he was retiring because he ""wanted to do something else"" -- added that if those issue continue to pester Democrats, ""you've got a 2010 kind of problem,"" referencing the midterm election when Democrats lost 63 seats.""It's a valid concern,"" Vela said of worries about retirements. ""If we'd been in the middle of midterms last month, I think even seats like mine could have gotten lost. But I don't think that is going to happen next year.""'We haven't hit Christmas yet'One of the reasons for gloom inside the Democratic caucus is that many of the members have experienced this trend before. In 2010, two years after President Barack Obama was elected, both parties had to deal with retirements -- 17 for Democrats, compared to 20 for Republicans. But voters still dealt a stinging blow to Democrats and vaulted Republican into power with a 63-seat shift.""In 2010, it was far worse than anything since because several of those retirements came from overwhelmingly Republican districts that Democrats really couldn't compete for once the incumbents had retired,"" said Ferguson. Ferguson added that one reason these retirements -- along with some of this year's -- are particularly powerful is because they came from districts that became remarkably difficult for Democrats to defend.""Not all retirements are equal, and retirements from seats you are unlikely to hold are the worse retirements,"" said Ferguson, who said a silver lining for the party is that only a few of the retirements this year have come in highly competitive districts.Retirements hit Republicans hard in 2018, with the party having to deal with a substantial 37 departures. Republicans at the time worried the figure presaged numerous defeats just two years after Trump took office. And they were right. Democrats would take back the House in 2018, dealing a blow to Trump and Republican control of Washington. ""The biggest problem is the surprise and the uncertainty.

""When these pop up, often times, they are putting you in a worse spot than you were before. And it sucks up time and finding candidates to run and money.""Gorman, like other political watchers, thinks Democrats' retirement problem is about to grow.

Stephanie Murphy announced Monday that she will not seek a fourth term in Congress, the latest in a rapid series of retirements within the Democratic ranks that suggest momentum is moving heavily against the party as it seeks to hold on to its razor-thin majority next November.Murphy's decision came less than 24 hours after New Jersey Rep. Albio Sires said he would be retiring at the end of this Congress. And, just before the Sires' news, California Rep. Alan Lowenthal said he, too, would be stepping aside. All together, there are now 22 Democrats retiring or running for other offices this election cycle as opposed to just 11 Republicans doing the same.Two years ago, just nine Democrats had announced their retirement plans at this point of the election while 24 Republicans had done the same, according to CNN's political unit.While there will always be some amount of attrition in a chamber as large as the House, the ""who"" is leaving should worry Democrats.Read MoreTake Murphy. She is widely regarded as a rising star within the party and was expected to run for Senate in 2022 until fellow Rep. Val Demings (D) got into the race against Sen. Marco Rubio (R).

Her 7th District has been targeted by state House Republicans in the Florida redistricting process but it was not yet clear what the final seat would look like. Without Murphy in the race, Republican map-makers will likely work to make the seat considerably more friendly to their side.Losing a member like Murphy -- a prodigious fundraiser and a talented campaigner -- is always a blow but more so in an election like this one where Democrats are clinging to their majority. Ditto retirements of powerful chairs like John Yarmuth (Budget Committee) and Eddie Bernice Johnson (Science, Space and Technology Committee).When these sorts of members walk away -- either from powerful posts or promising careers -- it send a very clear signal to every single member of the Democratic caucus: Things are bad, I don't see them getting better and now's the time to head for the hills.And that message, of course, has a snowball effect as other members wondering about whether to run again see that their colleagues have concluded now is the time to go and jump ship themselves.The Point: House Democratic leaders have worked desperately to avoid a rush to the exits from within their ranks. It appears they have failed."

And lots of those undecided members will be making go/no-go decisions in the next few weeks. As The Washington Post's Paul Kane noted last month:""The holiday season, from Thanksgiving through Christmas and into the new year, serves traditionally as a gut-check moment for lawmakers.""From 2011 through 2020, the final two months of the off year and January of the election year have prompted the most retirement announcements for members of the House, according to data compiled by Ballotpedia.""Which is why Democrats have to hope that tomorrow -- or the rest of this week -- doesn't bring any more retirement announcements.The Point: Politics is a copycat business -- right down to the decision of when to retire. Democratic leaders need to make staying in Congress look as good as possible these next few weeks.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story wrongly described Rep. Jackie Speier's congressional seat in one instance. Speier is a member of the House of Representatives."

Republican Gov. Greg Abbott easily defeated two vocal but poor-performing rivals and is now set for a marquee battle with Democrat Beto O'Rourke, the former congressman, in the fall, per CNN projections.But down-ballot, the primary fireworks aren't over yet: Texas requires candidates to top 50% in order to advance directly to the general election. Otherwise, the top two primary finishers square off in a head-to-head runoff in May. CNN projected that embattled Attorney General Ken Paxton will face a runoff against state Land Commissioner George P. Bush, the latest member of the Bush family's political dynasty to emerge in Texas politics. Paxton's failure to reach the 50% threshold was the only negative mark on Tuesday for former President Donald Trump, whose slate of endorsed candidates largely cruised in GOP primaries. And the Democratic primary in Texas' 28th District -- between Rep. Henry Cuellar, the party's most conservative member of the US House, and progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros -- was still undecided as of early Wednesday morning. Read MoreHere are six takeaways from the Texas primaries: Governor's race is setTexas is set for a heavyweight match-up between Abbott, a prolific fundraiser with a $50 million war chest, and O'Rourke, the former Democratic congressman who has been his party's only hope at winning statewide in recent years. Poll worker shortages and other glitches emerge as Texans kick off this year's primary election seasonAbbott, who is seeking a third term, was always the favorite to win his party's nomination despite far-right criticism of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic in its early days. But he spent $15 million to be sure of it, fending off former Florida congressman and Texas Republican Party chairman Allen West and former state Sen. Don Huffines. O'Rourke, meanwhile, is seeking office for the third time in five years. His near-miss in the 2018 race against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz ignited Texas Democrats' hopes that the state, with a diverse and growing population and suburbs that have moved leftward, would soon become a battleground. Now, with a campaign focused on Abbott's management of the grid failure that left much of Texas without power after a winter storm last year, he'll seek to deliver on that promise in a year in which the national political environment could be much tougher for Democrats. Embattled AG faces runoff against BushTexas Attorney General Paxton was unable to reach the 50% support he needed to avoid a runoff, and will face a head-to-head match-up with a member of the state's best-known political family. Paxton, a Republican with former President Donald Trump's endorsement thanks to the attorney general's lawsuit seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, faced a crowded field of challengers. The efforts to oust him center on his legal troubles: Paxton has been under indictment since 2015 on securities fraud charges, and is being investigated by the FBI after former aides accused him of abusing the power of his office to help a political donor. As votes were being counted late Tuesday night, the second-leading vote-getter was Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush, the son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. He led former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman and US Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Trump ally. Bush had aligned himself much more closely with Trump than other members of the Bush family. He told supporters Tuesday night that Paxton ""is going to divert attention away from his legal problems and personal challenges"" during their runoff. Cisneros, Cuellar could be headed for another roundThe rematch between Rep. Henry Cuellar, the most conservative Democrat in the US House, and progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros, who nearly defeated him in 2020, was neck-and-neck Tuesday night. It could be headed for a runoff. Though Cuellar and Cisneros are both from Laredo, the race split along geographic lines: Counties closer to San Antonio overwhelmingly supported the more progressive Cisneros; along the border, Cuellar was dominant. Cuellar is a rare figure in Washington: a pro-gun rights, anti-abortion rights Democrat who outperforms the national party in an area where Democrats have rapidly lost ground to Republicans in recent presidential election cycles. The FBI searched Cuellar's house weeks before the primary election. He largely dropped off the campaign trail, relying on television ads. That progressives could not defeat a hobbled Cuellar offered a window into the party's left flank's struggles to connect with Latinos in South Texas. A silver lining for progressivesProgressives did have one victory to celebrate Tuesday night: Greg Casar, a former Austin city councilman, was projected to win the 35th Congressional District primary outright, avoiding a runoff. Casar, who was endorsed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and campaigned with New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is the favorite to win the seat in November. The 35th District, which stretches from Austin to San Antonio, is a new one drawn by Texas lawmakers during last year's redistricting. It became a target for progressives after Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett, the incumbent who had represented parts of the new district, chose to run in a neighboring district. 15th District also heads to a runoffThe most competitive US House race in Texas this year could come in the 15th District, a South Texas district that stretches from towns east of San Antonio to the Rio Grande Valley. A roadmap to the 2022 midterm electionsRepublican Monica De La Cruz, who came within 3 percentage points of defeating Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez in 2020, will win the Republican nomination, CNN projected. Gonzalez, meanwhile, is running in the neighboring 34th District. But Democrats will have to wait until May 24 to determine her opponent. On Tuesday, the results of the Democratic primary remained to be seen. Ruben Ramirez, an attorney and Afghanistan war veteran, led the field, followed by a tight contest between Michelle Vallejo, a progressive favorite, and attorney John Villarreal Rigney for the second runoff spot.Trump's 'big night in Texas'Trump took a victory lap Tuesday night after every candidate he endorsed in Texas either won or advanced to a runoff. ""Big night in Texas! All 33 candidates that were Trump endorsed have either won their primary election or are substantially leading in the case of a runoff,"" Trump said in a statement. Faulty ballots and frustration: Texans confront 'nightmare' effects of new election law as early voting kicks offThat was partly by design: Trump only endorsed Republicans who were either already favored or were locks to win. His endorsement carried weight, but was not enough to help Paxton avoid a runoff. Trump did not involve himself in the 8th District race to replace retiring US Rep. Kevin Brady. But virtually all of his allies, and every other power player in the GOP, did."

Greg Abbott, a two-term incumbent, will defeat a crowded field of GOP challengers to secure the gubernatorial nomination, while Beto O'Rourke, a former congressman and Senate and presidential candidate, will win the Democratic nomination, CNN projects.Votes are being counted in Texas in the first primaries of the 2022 midterms, with contests on both sides of the aisle poised to set the landscape for elections in November that could swing control of Congress to Republicans.Read MoreBut as the results came in, Texas shared the spotlight with President Joe Biden's State of the Union address on Capitol Hill and the rapidly escalating crisis in Ukraine, where invading forces from Russia are moving in on major cities across the country.Russian President Vladimir Putin's troops were camped out on the Ukrainian border when early voting began in Texas on February 14, and while the conflict appears unlikely to influence Tuesday night's elections, quick-moving events at home and abroad underscore the challenges facing candidates as the 2022 midterms begin in earnest.5 things to watch in the Texas primary electionThe banner contest on Tuesday revolved around Paxton, the two-term incumbent who filed a failed lawsuit seeking to effectively overturn the 2020 election and ran under a cloud of legal issues, with the possibility of more on the horizon. His GOP challengers, led by Bush and Guzman, argued he could endanger the GOP's effort to yet again sweep statewide offices.Polling ahead of Election Day showed Paxton with a commanding lead but suggested he would fall short of the majority he needed to win the nomination outright.Bush, the latest in a political dynasty that, even with the Republican Party now in thrall to former President Donald Trump, maintains a considerable stature in Texas political circles and this campaign amounted a referendum on the future of that dynasty.    Like Bush, Guzman, who spent more than a decade on the state's high court, is a relative moderate. The pair clashed in a recent debate, which saw Guzman question Bush's qualifications and Bush denounce Guzman as a ""gutter politician."" More troubling for Paxton, though, was been the candidacy of Gohmert, whose ideological and geographic base overlaps with Paxton's. The Democratic primary for attorney general will also go to a runoff, CNN projected.Hanging over the primary were concerns -- at least among Democrats and voting rights advocates -- about the effect of the state's restrictive new voting rules.Texas was the first of a number of Republican-led states to hold major elections after passing legislation, on the back of a political wave set off by Trump's long campaign to sow doubt over his loss in 2020, that complicates mail-in voting and outlaws other efforts to make the ballot more accessible. Some larger Texas counties have reported spikes in ballot rejections because would-be voters did not meet beefed-up and, to many, confusing new identification requirements.   As polls closed, Harris County officials warned of delays in reporting results, due to ""damaged ballot sheets that need to be duplicated,"" according to a press release issued by state election officials late Tuesday. Later that night, Harris County election officials said that this was merely a ""preliminary discussion"" of a possible delay, and on Wednesday, they were confident they would meet the deadline to count votes while disputing earlier reports of ""damaged ballots.""The primaries brought some poll worker shortages and other glitches, but Election Day itself was mostly calm -- with the scramble to fix the unusually high number of faulty mail-in ballots emerging as the biggest challenge from this first round of voting.The leading problem, said Isabel Longoria, who presides over elections in populous Harris County, was voters did not include identifying numbers on the return ballot envelopes under the flap. The tally of potential ballot rejections as of Monday would represent 30% of the mail-in-ballots submitted in the county. By contrast, fewer than 1% of mail-in ballots -- or about 8,300 ballots statewide -- were rejected in the 2020 general election, according to the US Election Assistance Commission.The decennial redistricting process has also added to primary night uncertainty -- and intrigue.With a new congressional map designed to further reduce the number of contested seats on the map, most of both parties' nominees can expect that their primaries will be more fiercely fought than the contests that await in November. The diminishing number of swing districts means there has been an even greater focus on campaigns that cast opposing flanks of the parties against one another.For Democrats, those contrasts have been on vivid display in the 28th Congressional District, where Rep. Henry Cuellar, one of the most conservative Democrats remaining in the House, and progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros will advance to a runoff, CNN projected Wednesday. Cisneros, a 28-year-old immigration attorney backed by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, nearly ousted the congressman from the South Texas seat in 2020.But his district is modestly more Democratic this time around, and Cisneros had received a late boost in the race when it was revealed that Cuellar is under investigation by the FBI. Cuellar has denied any wrongdoing, and the specifics of the probe largely remain a mystery.In a cruel twist for the left, however, progressive candidate Tannya Benavides, who earned nearly 5% of the vote, may have siphoned enough support from Cisneros to prevent her from securing the 50% needed to avoid a runoff. Henry Cuellar is a political institution in South Texas. An FBI raid and a second challenge by progressive Jessica Cisneros could topple himRepublicans, including Trump, outperformed expectations with Latino voters in the 2020 elections and Cuellar has argued that his harder line on immigration issues, in a district that runs from the San Antonio suburbs down to the Rio Grande Valley and along the border to Laredo, is the only path for Democrats in the region. But victory for Cisneros in May -- and, should she win, the makeup of her coalition -- will provide new insight into what the shifting margins from two years ago portend for the fall elections. Even in this first round of voting, the divisions in the party were clear from early in the night. Cisneros' backbone of support came from the San Antonio suburbs, while Cuellar dominated in the border counties -- a breakdown that will give both flanks of the party reason to celebrate and cause to fret. The Republican primary for the 28th District was not decided Tuesday, with Cassy Garcia, a former staffer to Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, advancing to the runoff, CNN projects. The second spot for that May contest had not yet been called as of midday Wednesday.While Cuellar's bid for survival captured the most attention, Republicans were also closely watching GOP turnout in other parts of South Texas after stepping up their recruitment of candidates to run in a region that has been dominated by Democrats for decades.Monica De La Cruz, who pulled off a surprising finish when she came within 3 points of dispatching Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez in 2020, will win the GOP nomination for the newly redrawn 15th District, CNN projects, bolstered by the endorsement of both Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.  Democrats look to win back Latino voters after Trump's inroads in South TexasThe crowded Democratic race to face off with De La Cruz will be decided in a runoff. Afghanistan veteran Ruben Ramirez, a lawyer and former high school teacher backed by Gonzalez, has secured his spot, CNN projects, but it remains unclear whether John Villarreal Rigney, an attorney and owner of a South Texas construction firm, or Michelle Vallejo, a progressive small business owner endorsed by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, will be joining him.Gonzalez is now running in the neighboring 34th District, which became more favorable for Democrats after redistricting. He will win his primary outright to move on the general election where he will face Mayra Flores, who will best three other candidates in the GOP primary, CNN projects. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the Cuellar-Cisneros race, another progressive backed by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, former Austin City Council Member Greg Casar, will advance to November, CNN projects, after earning a comfortable majority in the Democratic primary for the 35th District, a safe blue seat.On the Republican side, a perceived lack of fealty to Trump was among the factors that endangered incumbent Reps. Van Taylor and Dan Crenshaw. Taylor's opponents in the 3rd District had attacked him over his vote to establish an independent commission to investigate the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. The panel was rejected by Senate Republicans and effectively replaced by a select committee created by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. But Taylor's vote riled some Trump supporters, which fueled the opposition against him.CNN projected that Taylor would advance to a May runoff against former Collin County Judge Keith Self, but the congressman suspended his reelection bid on Wednesday after admitting to an extra-marital affair. Allegations of Taylor's infidelity surfaced in right-wing media days before Tuesday's primary. Crenshaw, who ran unopposed in the 2020 GOP primary, triumphed over multiple challengers in the 2nd District attacking him from the right -- a consequence, in part, of Texas Republicans' gerrymandering of the district to make it a safe red seat. Crenshaw is one of the most conservative members in the GOP conference, and was a signatory to Paxton's 2020 election lawsuit, but he has occasionally sparred with the former President's closest allies, including Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, most recently criticizing her for speaking at a White nationalist conference over the weekend. Greene and North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn were also opposing GOP leadership in the race to replace retiring GOP Rep. Kevin Brady in Texas' 8th District. Former Navy SEAL Morgan Luttrell is the national party's choice, but far-right opponent Christian Collins had the backing of Greene, Cawthorn, Cruz, and Joe Arpaio, the former Maricopa County, Arizona, sheriff who was pardoned by Trump. The race was undecided as of Wednesday morning.This story has been updated with additional developments."

Now, while it's fascinating to see the race -- and the results -- as a proxy war between the old face of the Republican Party (the Bushes) and its new face (Trump), the reality is slightly more nuanced.First, Paxton finds himself in significant legal jeopardy. In 2015, shortly after being elected as Texas attorney general, Paxton was indicted on charges of securities fraud. He pleaded not guilty and the trial continues to be delayed amid legal wrangling on both sides. Then, in October 2020, seven Paxton aides accused him of bribery and abuse of office -- charges that Paxton denied. (The FBI is reportedly looking into the allegations.)Bush, who currently serves as Texas Land Commissioner, made Paxton's legal problems a key part of his case against the incumbent. In a speech on Tuesday night, he argued that nominating Paxton would cost Republicans the office in the fall. ""That's what's at stake in this race,"" he said, according to the Texas Tribune. ""That's what this campaign is about. It's not about one individual. It's about preserving conservative values in our state.""Second, Bush isn't exactly a chip off the old block. While his father called Trump ""unhinged"" during the 2016 primary campaign, the younger Bush has been much more willing to bend the knee to the former President.In the days before he formally entered the attorney race in the summer of 2021, George P. Bush tweeted a picture of himself on a cell phone with this caption: ""Great to speak with President Trump to discuss the future of Texas and how we are keeping up the fight to put America first. I appreciate the words of encouragement and support.""At the announcement itself, Bush supporters were handing out koozies that featured a drawing of him and Trump with a 2019 quote from the former President that read: ""This is the only Bush that likes me. This is the Bush that got it right. I like him."" (George P. Bush endorsed Trump in the 2020 race, calling him ""the only thing standing between America and socialism."")So, like I said, it's not totally clear-cut that Paxton's failure to avoid a runoff  is purely a referendum on the Bush family vs. Trump dynamic. But whether George P. Bush has said nice things about Trump in the past (and vice-versa), it is unmistakably true that he is the son of Jeb Bush and that Trump weighed in for Paxton early and strongly in the primary fight.Which means this is something of a proxy fight between the two sides. And it's only going to get more intense over the next two and a half months."

Over the past two years, these two friends have bonded through the twists and turns of the Covid-19 pandemic. But they diverge sharply over politics in this heavily Latino region of Texas, which had been viewed as a Democratic stronghold -- until 2020.  Former President Donald Trump dramatically improved his performance in many of the counties bordering Mexico compared to four years earlier -- gains that led the GOP this year to redouble efforts to recruit and invest in South Texas candidates, including many of Hispanic descent, up and down the ballot. The question now is whether the inroads the GOP made in 2020 will hold as Democrats try to cling to their House majority in November.  Albino Zuniga believes overly generous Covid-19 benefits have slowed the economic recovery. ""If you're going to be something in life, you have to do it by yourself,"" he said during an interview at the Pulga Los Portales flea market in Alton, Texas.Tuesday's primaries in the Lone Star State -- the first congressional primaries of 2022 -- are an early test for the two parties as they try to turn out voters like Acosta, 40, and Zuniga, 56, with control of Congress eventually hinging on narrowly divided districts like this one.  CNN spoke to several dozen Latino voters across the region, including here in the newly redrawn 15th District, an open seat that runs from the populous border areas near McAllen north to towns east of San Antonio. They raised an array of reasons why Trump resonated here more in 2020 than in 2016 -- namely his relentless focus on getting the economy reopened after Covid shutdowns -- as well as factors Democrats may need to address to win some of them back in 2022. Read MoreThough many of his family members are Democrats, Zuniga backed Trump in the last presidential election, saying the then-President's message on immigration resonated for him as a legal immigrant from Mexico and the father of a Border Patrol agent. Trump's message about getting people back to work mid-pandemic also connected with the ethos of hard work and self-reliance Zuniga says is inherent in Hispanic culture along the border. He was repelled, Zuniga said, by what he sees as the liberal drift of the Democratic Party. Those feelings only deepened as he watched President Joe Biden and the Democrat-controlled Congress hand out more Covid-related benefits to certain individuals that he believes have been too generous.  People play lotería for a chance to win prizes at the Pulga Los Portales.Though earlier Covid relief packages were passed under Trump with Republican support, that was a frequent criticism of Biden that CNN heard here from both Democratic and GOP voters voicing concerns about the economy and inflation.But Acosta hopes Latino voters will reward Democrats in November for economic relief passed by Congress under Biden, arguing that Republicans often look after the wealthy instead of those in need. He is supporting the congressional candidacy of progressive Democrat Michelle Vallejo, who co-owns Pulga Los Portales with her family and has championed a $15 minimum wage and Medicare for All.""The Rio Grande Valley is divided because there's a need for so many things like better salaries and infrastructure,"" Acosta said. ""Democrats are mostly focused on helping the people and if they help people, we should support them.""  Michelle Vallejo, Democratic candidate for Texas' 15th Congressional District, says Democrats must ""show up"" and do a better job explaining to South Texans how their party's policies will improve their lives. She co-owns the Pulga Los Portales flea market with her family. Democrats seek to re-engage South Texas Latinos   Stemming further losses among South Texas Latinos in 2022 and beyond first requires Democrats to diagnose what went wrong nearly two years ago -- an exercise that more than a dozen political strategists, organizers and party officials who work in this region answer with different theories.  The root cause, many Democrats say, was the party's suspension of most in-person campaigning and door-knocking during the pandemic, which they say allowed Republicans to lead one-sided conversations with voters.  ""Democrats literally tried to phone it in, and you can't do that,"" said Beto O'Rourke, the former Democratic congressman who's running for governor, as he made a recent swing through Brownsville to knock on doors. Trump, he added, offered ""a false choice between health and jobs,"" while ""we left the field to them, literally, completely."" Beto O'Rourke, Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate, and his wife Amy O'Rourke canvass a neighborhood in Brownsville, Texas, on Saturday, February 19. But Sylvia Bruni, the chair of the Webb County Democrats, has urged her party to also take a harder look at aspects of the national Democratic message in 2020 and how it played in South Texas. There's a disconnect, for example, between strong support for abortion rights among Democrats nationally and voters in an area where Catholic views are deeply held. The disconnect sometimes extends to immigration and climate, too, amid concerns about border security in the Latino community here and anxiety about some Democrats' embrace of the Green New Deal in a region where jobs emanate from oil and gas.  Bruni believes that Democrats did not effectively counter Republican messaging in 2020, especially on abortion, guns and oil and gas. ""There was no message. ... It was really, 'Hi, I'm Sylvia. I'm a Democrat. I hear you're a Democrat. Are you going to vote for Joe Biden?' That was the message...and the others were eating our lunch.""  She worries her party has not yet settled on strong, unifying themes for 2022 that will appeal to Latino voters and reverse GOP gains in the region. Webb County Democratic Party Chair Sylvia Bruni, seen here at the party's headquarters in Laredo in November 2020, says Democrats must re-examine how their national message on abortion, guns and oil and gas can alienate some voters. ""If you do an inventory of everything this man, Biden, has been able to accomplish, it's really pretty impressive. But he's in a field of alligators, fielding off attacks and then working with a Congress that is absolutely hellbent on obstructing everything he does,"" she said. ""I know we have the substance from which to create the messages that fit the values of our community,"" she said. So far, ""I don't think we're getting it.""  Latinos were still a key part of both Biden's national coalition and his success in the Texas suburbs. Overall, Trump defeated Biden in the Lone Star State by less than 6 points in 2020 after defeating 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by 9 points four years earlier. But Biden's winning margins in many of the counties along the border were much narrower than Clinton's in 2016. The operating assumption among Democrats was that Trump's rhetoric about immigration -- dating back to his 2015 remarks that Mexico was sending criminals and rapists across the border -- would continue to alienate Latino voters. Instead, he notched symbolic wins in places like Zapata County, flipping it from blue to red four years after Clinton had won it by 33 points.  Monica De La Cruz, Republican candidate for Texas' 15th District,  argues that the GOP message on immigration resonates with Hispanic voters in South Texas. The margins in several Democratically held congressional districts in the Rio Grande Valley, including the current version of the 15th District, also tightened significantly in 2020. Republican Monica De La Cruz, who came within 3 points of toppling Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, is vying for the redrawn seat this year -- this time with more vocal support from Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. After changes to the district lines, Gonzalez is running in the neighboring 34th District, where the turf looks more favorable to Democrats. Current Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela, who held his seat with 55% of the vote last cycle, is retiring.Both De La Cruz and Mayra Flores, a high-profile Latina running for the GOP nomination in the 34th District, are bullish about the November general election in their districts, in part because they believe Democrats have fundamentally miscalculated the concerns that many Latino voters have about management of the southern border, the treatment of Border Patrol agents and the influx of undocumented immigrants -- a central focus of their campaigns.  ""The Hispanic values of faith, family, and freedom have always been the same,"" De La Cruz said during a recent interview at the Republican National Committee Hispanic Community Center in McAllen. Leaning into GOP talking points about the Democratic Party moving toward socialism, she alleged Democrats embrace critical race theory and disrespect law enforcement. ""None of those values are reflective of what Hispanics feel and what they stand for,"" she said. JUST WATCHED﻿Latinas are pushing for a Republican revolution in South TexasReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH﻿Latinas are pushing for a Republican revolution in South Texas 04:17Flores, who immigrated to the US as a child from Mexico and describes herself as a ""walk-away"" from the Democratic Party after voting for Barack Obama in 2008, said concerns about border security particularly resonate with many South Texans. ""We have families in Mexico that we are not visiting anymore because we're afraid,"" said Flores, who is married to a Border Patrol agent, as she went door to door talking to voters in Brownsville recently. ""We don't want what we're afraid of to come here.""  She thinks Democrats took their votes for granted. ""That's what happened in 2020. The Hispanic community in South Texas said, 'Hey, you do not own our vote. We are not loyal to you. And if you don't get to work, we're going to vote you out.'""  Mayra Flores argues South Texas Democrats have taken Hispanic voters for granted. Gonzalez, the incumbent who narrowly defeated De La Cruz in 2020 and now could face Flores in November if they both win their primaries, called that fiction.   ""Trump didn't do well because he was a Republican. It was his personality -- this bravado, lucha libre, if you will, that was attractive to many Latinos,"" he told CNN. Like O'Rourke, he argued that restrictive campaign protocols during the pandemic led to the erosion in the Democratic Party's Latino support in South Texas. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, who represents the 15th District and is a candidate for the redrawn 34th District, speaks alongside gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke during a blockwalk kickoff event at Garfield Park in Brownsville, Texas.From the stage at a recent Tejano Democrats event, Gonzalez said some South Texans need to be reminded that Democrats brought them programs like Social Security and Medicare.""These people that think they're Republicans, many have just forgotten where they come from, and how we arrived and how we got here,"" he said.Democrat Ruben Ramirez, whose candidacy for the 15th District has been endorsed by Gonzalez, said Democrats must also connect with the economic anxiety that voters are feeling, which he tries to do by sharing his childhood experiences of living out of a car with his mom at one point and collecting extra cereal at school to bring home for his siblings. He often speaks to voters about how he thinks Democratic programs would ""help lift all boats.""Democrat Ruben Ramirez, who's running for the 15th District and is seen here outside the Lark Community Center early voting polling location in McAllen, says Democrats must do a better job explaining how their agenda would ""break the bonds of poverty"" for South Texas families. Examining the 2020 shifts toward the GOP and where the Democratic message fell short, Equis Research, a Democratic-leaning polling and research consortium, found that Trump's approval rating in the final year before the 2020 election improved notably among both Latina voters and conservative Latino voters who displayed greater motivation to vote than in 2016. Equis Research co-founder Stephanie Valencia said one reason was that Latino voters in South Texas were more focused on their concerns about unemployment and the economy in 2020 than on Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, which had dominated the conversation in 2016. The anxiety over Covid-19 shutdowns and the economy, Equis Research concluded, ""created a permission structure for formerly hesitant Latinos to embrace Trump's candidacy.""  Valencia noted that Latinos have experienced the pandemic in a very direct way as essential workers, caretakers and small business owners. Trump spoke to their concerns about ""keeping the lights on,"" she said, and now ""there's a huge opportunity for the Biden administration to go out and sell its economic agenda, its job creation agenda to Latinos.""  A mariachi band performs amid supporters of local Democratic candidates, including Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, outside the Brownsville Public Library polling location during early voting for the 2022 primary.Steep challenges for Democrats in a difficult economic climate But the hurdles facing Democrats are evident in conversations with many Latino voters here in South Texas.  Joel Martinez, a 42-year-old corrections officer who said he voted for Trump because of his business background, echoed concerns about government stimulus money.  ""The whole stimulus thing, it's just supporting more -- I'm sorry to say it -- laziness,"" he said as he emerged from a polling place in Edinburg. ""You see it everywhere we go -- 'Help wanted' -- and nobody wants to fill in the gaps.""  There are different reasons behind the labor shortage and a fierce debate about whether extended unemployment benefits, stimulus checks and the child tax credit championed by the Biden administration have kept Americans from returning to work sooner. Inflation is also weighing heavily on Americans -- leading some voters here to blame Biden and Democrats, while others say that accusation is unfair. Republicans and Democrats stand side by side as they campaign for local candidates outside a polling location in Edinburg, Texas, during early voting.Nancy Morales, a 43-year-old Edinburg voter who used to be a Democrat but supported Trump, blamed high prices on pandemic-era stimulus passed under Biden and Democrats. She shuddered thinking about her recent bill for dinner at Chili's and said she now reconsiders every trip out of the house because it costs so much to fill up her truck.""Everything's going up,"" she said. ""I bought a lemon for 48 cents! Each lemon! I was like 'This is crazy!'""  She hopes Republicans will have better ideas for getting prices under control and she is cheering on the new crop of GOP Latina candidates like De La Cruz, who she had just voted for in the 15th District primary. ""I said, 'Woo! We need a change here. Let's go ladies!'""Lusia Cortina, who sells pre-arranged funeral plans at the Pulga Los Portales, said President Joe Biden has ""been doing okay"" but that life doesn't feel normal yet. Lusia Cortina, a Democrat who sells pre-arranged funeral plans at her stall at the Pulga Los Portales, said much of the economic blame Biden is shouldering is unfair and credits him with helping things return closer to a pre-pandemic normal. But even she criticized Biden (and Trump) for presiding over ""too much spending"" that she thinks led to over-reliance on the government.  ""Now people don't want to even look for jobs,"" she said, arguing that Biden and his party need to convey it's up to Americans to ""get up on their own, instead of just handing them over the money.""Both O'Rourke and Vallejo, the Democratic candidate who co-owns the Pulga Los Portales, stressed that connecting with voters' more local concerns over last year's widespread power outages, for example, and the number of uninsured and under-insured people here will be critical in 2022.  Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (center left), now running for governor, and Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (right) speak with Robert Lopez (far left) and James Roussett while canvassing a neighborhood in Brownsville.""People are burned out. People are exhausted. People are concerned about how they could even make their day-by-day functional,"" Vallejo said. ""Every single day we're showing up. ... We're letting people know that there is someone here in the fight."""

But China's response to its worst outbreak of Covid-19 in two years is a reminder that the conflict isn't the only risk to the recovery.What's happening: The world's second-largest economy is pushing ahead with its ""zero-Covid"" strategy, even as many other governments decide it's time to learn to live with the virus.Shenzhen, an important tech hub, has entered a weeklong lockdown after the city recorded 66 positive cases on Saturday. All businesses except those deemed essential have paused operations or have implemented working from home. Shanghai, China's largest business center, has also imposed stringent measures following a spike in cases, closing schools and movie theaters and restricting travel into the city.Who gets hit: Foxconn, one of Apple's biggest suppliers, has suspended its operations in Shenzhen, where it has two major campuses. It said Monday that the date factory work will resume will ""be advised by the local government."" The Taiwanese company said it had shifted production to other sites to ""minimize the potential impact"" from the disruption, but didn't specify which locations would take on extra work.Read MoreUncertainty around Foxconn's production is one sign of how China's response to the jump in coronavirus infections will ripple around the world. The country recorded 2,125 local cases on Sunday across 58 cities.Lockdowns in China could further drive up container shipping costs, which remain extremely high, and scramble global supply chains that are still trying to sort through pandemic-related delays.""If there is a case found in the Yantian port [in Shenzhen], then there could be a port suspension for at least two weeks,"" economists at ING told clients Monday. ""That will then affect exports and imports of electronic parts and goods.""That could make inflation even worse. Spending inside China, an important engine of the country's growth, could also be affected by a new wave of Covid restrictions.""This is certainly the worst virus situation in China since the Wuhan lockdown, and threatens the growth outlook as the domestic consumption will take another hit,"" Commerzbank economists Hao Zhou and Bernd Weidensteiner said Monday.Remember: China's growth target of about 5.5% this year was already its lowest in three decades. The country's economy expanded 8.1% in 2021, but the pace of growth dropped sharply in the final months of the year.War has brought the world to the brink of a food crisisSvein Tore Holsether says the world is careening toward a food crisis that could affect millions of people.Record high natural gas prices have forced the company he runs, fertilizer producer Yara International, to curtail its production of ammonia and urea in Europe to 45% of capacity. With less of those two essential agricultural ingredients, he expects knock-on effects for global food supplies.War has brought the world to the brink of a food crisis""It's not whether we are going to have a food crisis. It's how large that crisis will be,"" Holsether told me.Step back: More than two weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, the prices of key agricultural products produced in the region have skyrocketed. The biggest problem is wheat, a pantry staple. Supplies from Russia and Ukraine, which together account for almost 30% of global wheat trade, are now at risk. Global wheat prices hit an all-time high last week.There's more: Another major problem is access to fertilizer. Essential for farmers to hit their production targets for crops, it's never been more expensive, as exports from Russia grind to a halt. Output in Europe has also plunged thanks to the surging price of natural gas, an essential ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers like urea.The situation is ringing alarm bells for global food experts. Agriculture ministers from the G7 countries met Friday to discuss the looming fallout.""Any further increase in food price levels and volatility in international markets could threaten food security and nutrition at a global scale, especially among the most vulnerable living in environments of low food security,"" they said in a statement after the meeting.Russia and Ukraine serve as the breadbasket for countries in the Middle East and North Africa that depend on imports. The United States and Europe will feel the pain, too, since the run-up in prices for important agricultural goods will affect businesses that produce food in every market.Uber's fuel surcharge could be just the beginningEveryone is feeling pain at the pump — even Uber (UBER).The ride-sharing service has announced that it's rolling out a fuel surcharge to help its drivers offset the burden of higher gas prices for at least the next two months, my CNN Business colleague Ramishah Maruf reports.Starting Wednesday, users will pay an extra $0.45 or $0.55 per trip and an additional $0.35 or $0.45 for Uber Eats, depending on the location. Uber said all the money from the surcharges will go to drivers.""We know that prices have been going up across the economy, so we've done our best to help drivers and couriers without placing too much additional burden on consumers,"" said Liza Winship, head of driver operations for the US and Canada.Uber said switching to electric vehicles will be the best way to avoid skyrocketing gas prices in the long term. It's giving up to $4,000 annually to drivers who use electric cars and has partnered with Hertz to make as many as 50,000 Teslas available for drivers to rent by 2023.In the meantime, though, soaring fuel costs are likely to bite. And Uber won't be alone in deciding it needs to pass some of the expense along to its customers.On the radar: Passengers could also start to see surcharges on flights, since fuel accounts for between 20% and 30% of airline operating costs.Up nextThe Producer Price Index, a key gauge of US inflation, arrives Tuesday."

Recent hires already have a lot on their plates when it comes to making a good impression, but forging relationships with your new co-workers should also be a high priority, even if you've never met them in person. ""It is very important to build personal connections with people at work,"" said Jennifer Benz, a senior vice president at human resources consulting firm Segal. ""If you have those strong personal relationships at work in the tough times and the good times, you are going to have a better support system, and that's really important not just for your happiness, but also for your professional success.""If you are joining a company remotely or only occasionally seeing your team in person, here are some ways to get to know them better: Be intentional Read MoreWhen random hallway introductions and spontaneous walks for coffee aren't an option, you need to be more intentional about setting up get-to-know-you chats.""It will require effort ... if you want to forge relationships when you are new,"" said Tessa White, CEO of The Job Doctor. ""They won't come to you, you have to go to them, which means you have to expend extra effort in whatever feels most natural to you.""Ask your manager for recommendations of people to reach out to and connect with.Congrats on your first job! Here's what to do with your 401(k)And these casual meetings don't have to take place in front of a screen. ""Take a meeting while walking your dog, anything that creates connection,"" said White. She added that asking questions like: ""How can I help you in your job?"" or ""Tell me something you'd like me to know that I don't know about you,"" can help get conversations going.   But also asking new colleagues about their own personal career path can help them open up on a more personal level and provide advice.   ""Ask people: 'What were your first few weeks like and what helped you navigate that time?'"" suggested career coach Octavia Goredema, author of Prep, Push, Pivot: Essential Career Strategies for Underrepresented Women. Ask for a buddy If your company's onboarding process doesn't include a person assigned to help you get to know the organization and make introductions, Benz suggested asking for someone. And that person shouldn't be your manager. Check the company's handbook or internal website for other ways to connect with colleagues, including employee resource groups (ERGs), a mentorship program or volunteer activities.  ""Those are going to be other opportunities to meet people and build connections beyond the immediate group of people you work with day-to-day,"" said Benz.You can also ask to be connected with other recent hires -- even if they aren't on your team. ""Someone who is just a few months ahead of you has a perspective that will be so helpful,"" said Goredema.Set goals: small and big When starting a new job, it's always a good idea to set short- and long-term goals for your role, and also map out the relationships you want to cultivate, suggested Goredema.""Think about whose support is going to be pivotal to your success,"" she said.For instance, a short-term goal could be remembering the names of the people on your team and knowing something specific about them. ""Also, think about what you would want them to know about you,"" she added. And because it takes a few months to get acclimated, Goredema, suggested taking notes. ""Keep a cheat sheet that can help you when you go back and reflect on with who've you met and what you've observed.""A longer-term goal could be learning your manager's and team's expectations and aligning your own expectations with them, including knowing how they like to communicate, how they interact and what the deliverables are.  Ask to shadow Ask your manager if you can listen in on meetings virtually if appropriate, that can help you meet new people as well as learn the company's meeting culture. ""Asking to shadow someone and being able to sit in on meetings and ask questions and debrief after the meeting -- that is a great way to learn,"" said Benz. She also recommended offering to take notes or track any follow-ups after the meeting or help with any prep. ""That is going to be a benefit for your team as well as for your learning.""Make the most of your in-office daysIf you work in person part of the time, ask your teammates when they'll be in the office and set up lunch, in-person meetings and coffee runs in advance. ""And if you're the young professional on your team who has the most flexibility in your schedule, then [match] to what the other folks on your team are doing and where you can interact and have the most time with them in person,"" said Benz. Turn your camera on As we head into year three of the pandemic, we're all tired of being on camera for meetings. But it can be hard to remember a person's name if you can't envision their face, so Goredema suggested turning your video on to help forge better connections. ""It's not just what you share...it's how you show up and how you are present,"" she said. ""Video meetings are a great opportunity to show  clues to who you are -- professionally of course."" She said adding your favorite books on a shelf behind you, or a mug with your alma mater or favorite sports team can help get a conversation going. ""All of these things help forge connections and associations."""

Most were for a few months, like after the birth of her daughter or after an infection put her in a medically induced coma and she had to relearn how to walk. One break, after she left a job she was unhappy with and then searched for a new one, lasted a year. Puckett is currently working on a contract basis and is looking for a full-time job. During job interviews, she said it's almost inevitable that recruiters will ask her about the gaps on her resume.""This is real life, things happen ... there are life events that you have to process,"" said Puckett, who lives in the Atlanta area. ""As I get further in my career ... I feel like I [shouldn't have to] keep explaining and re-explaining it...I have experience, I have portfolios, I have recommendations and references. Why do we get hung up on these minor details?"" 4 reasons why this jobs report matters to your walletCareer gaps on resumes have long been seen as red flags to some recruiters and hiring managers. Sometimes there is a concern that the time away leaves the candidate with technological gaps or a need for more time to acclimate back into their role, or there's a fear that they aren't serious about returning, explained Carol Fishman Cohen, CEO and co-founder of iRelaunch, which helps companies launch and expand programs that help employees return to the workforce.Read More""Historically, there were some really conscious bias around career gaps, some of it warranted, some if it not, "" said Jeramy Kaiman, head of LHH Recruitment Solutions, West at the Adecco Group. But with millions of Americans dropping out of the workforce during the pandemic for a range of reasons -- they lost their job, needed to care for a family member, had childcare and remote learning responsibilities, sought a career change or decided to retire early -- attitudes about gaps on a resume have begun to shift. ""The pandemic has definitely lessened the stigma around career breaks,"" said Fishman Cohen. ""[They're] more common now and recruiters and hiring managers are getting used to seeing them on resumes.""Child care worker shortage strands half a million familiesNow, many of the workers who took a break during the pandemic are starting to re-enter the workforce, according to Kaiman. ""Because it was such a high volume of people who chose to stay home for a variety of reasons and the labor market is so tight, those things factored in together made it that employers are much more flexible now about their 'red flags' toward longer career gaps."" In fact, LinkedIn launched a new feature Tuesday that gives users the option of adding ""career breaks"" to the experience section of their profile. Users can enter dates and choose a reason for the gap, including caregiving, bereavement, career transition, layoff, health and well-being, travel and volunteer work. They can also include additional details on how they spent the time.""It allows you to openly embrace the time you took away from work on your profile and show how these life experiences ... apply to prospective jobs,"" said Camilla Han-He, senior product manager, profile and identity products at LinkedIn.LinkedIn's new ""career breaks"" feature allows users to add details about their time out of the workforce.She added the more people share their career breaks, the more it will help normalize them. ""By giving people a recognized way to proudly display their career breaks in their profile, we are letting the world know that taking a career break is professional,"" Han-He said.While Kaiman thinks the shift in attitude toward career gaps is here to stay, he said applicants who have career gaps and have changed jobs frequently might still give employers pause. ""When they have career gaps coupled with a lot of job mobility, I think that is a red flag employers are still going to have some concerns about."" How to address the gapIf a potential employer asks about a career break, Fishman Cohen said the key is to acknowledge the break and focus on why you are the best candidate for the job. She suggested bringing up anecdotes from previous work or volunteer experiences that showcase your skills. How to handle a pandemic-related gap on your resume She also suggested keeping the focus away from the lapse between jobs during interviews. ""The important thing isn't when you had the experience, but that you had the experience,"" she said. ""So instead of saying, this is ancient history but way back in 2010 we faced a very similar customer challenge, you would say: 'When I was working for company X we faced very similar customer challenges, let me tell you about one of them.'"" For job seekers who have been looking a while, Kaiman suggested focusing on the things you've been doing during the gap, like new skills training or any relevant experiences that make you a strong candidate, and how you are being selective about your next opportunity.""Discuss the reasons you were searching for the right job versus discussing the inability to find a job,"" he said. ""That makes you look more confident in the reason for the longer unemployed gap."""

","success, Working remotely in a different state than your employer? Here's what that means for your taxes - CNN",Working remotely in a different state than your employer? Here's what that means for your taxes,"If you're among the employed Americans who were allowed to work remotely during the pandemic last year, count your blessings. But if you worked from a state other than the one where your employer is based, you may have to pay up for that privilege come tax time. Here's why: You are now going to be subject to the income tax rules of two or more states (depending on how many states you worked from remotely last year). Employers take note: Most remote workers don't want to go back to the officeAt the very least you likely will have to file more than one state tax return for 2021, which will cost you more if you're paying someone else to prepare your taxes.And in some instances -- primarily involving five states that have so-called convenience rules (more on those in a minute) -- you may even be double-taxed on the same income.That's why the best advice is to consult an experienced tax professional well versed in state tax law to help assess your situation. ""Talk to someone. Figure out what the rules are. Then chart out your game plan from there,"" said Timothy Noonan, the tax residency practice leader at law firm Hodgson Russ LLP.Read MoreEach state makes its own tax rules All but nine states impose income tax on earnings. And each one sets its own parameters for determining who must file a return and who owes income tax.To say the states' rules are ""all over the map"" is apt here.There are rules governing taxation of people working remotely for in-state and out-of-state employers. There are rules that will trigger the income tax for non-residents after they work in-state for more than a minimum amount of time or earn a minimum amount of money doing so. And if you worked remotely from a state for more than 183 days last year, you may even be characterized as a resident for tax purposes.Plainly put, ""it is super confusing,"" said Lorraine Cohen, partner at Deloitte Tax LLP. A potential double taxation scenarioMost states assert the right to tax someone's income on the basis of their physical presence generating that income within its borders, Cohen noted. So if your employer is based in one of these states and you worked remotely last year from another state with a similar rule, chances are fair you won't be double taxed on the same income.But your chances for double taxation go up if your employer is based in one of the five states -- Connecticut, Delaware, Nebraska, New York, and Pennsylvania -- that have what's called a ""convenience rule."" That rule basically asserts that a state has the right to impose an income tax on wages you earned while working for an employer based in that state, even if you choose to perform your job remotely from another state. The only exception: If your employer directs you to work out of state for its convenience, say because they need you to work at another branch for a period. ""If your office is in a convenience rule state, you can owe taxes both there and in [the other] state on the same income,"" said Jared Walzcak, vice president of state projects at the Tax Foundation.Don't panic if you got a scary IRS noticeOne example of this: If you were employed by a New York-based organization but chose to work remotely from California last year, New York will tax your income on the basis of its convenience rule. And California would tax your income earned while you were telecommuting from the state.The good news: Some states will yield to the state imposing a convenience rule. Or sometimes, two neighboring states may strike a ""reverse credit"" agreement that will help a remote worker avoid double taxation, although it may still subject them to a higher tax rate than they would ordinarily pay. Cohen and her Deloitte colleagues offered this example in a recent article for Tax Notes: ""An Oregon resident who works remotely in California is only subject to tax in California on the California liability amount that exceeds the Oregon liability amount. In contrast, a California resident working temporarily in Oregon would not have any Oregon tax liability because the California tax rate on wages exceeds Oregon's tax rate."" Or neighboring states might strike a ""reciprocal agreement"" -- such as one that exists between New Jersey and Pennsylvania -- that will clarify a resident of one state working in the other will only owe taxes to their resident state under certain conditions.But you should assume nothing. Instead, get the facts specific to your case before plowing ahead with your 2021 tax returns."

","success, Common credit score myths and truths - CNN",Don't believe these 8 common credit score myths,"You probably already know that you need a good credit score to get the best interest rates on a mortgage or auto loan, which can make a big difference to your budget over time. ""With something like a mortgage, even a minor difference in rates can have a big impact on your monthly payment and can mean tens of thousands of dollars or more over the life of the loan,"" said Justin Pritchard, a certified financial planner and founder of Approach Financial. But that's just the beginning of how the three-digit number impacts your financial life. Your credit score, a rating of your credit worthiness, can also affect the rate that you pay for insurance, your cell phone plan, and even your ability to land certain types of jobs.But despite the importance of credit scores, they remain widely misunderstood. Here's a look at several common misconceptions.Read More#1: Carrying a credit card balance will improve your score Nearly 60% of consumers believe this myth, according to a recent survey by US New & World Report. One of the main factors in determining your credit score is your credit utilization ratio, or the percentage of your available credit that you're using at any given time. The lower the number, the better -- but aim to keep it under 30%.What will my monthly mortgage payment be?""You don't want to carry a balance, because that's just pushing up your utilization ratio,"" said Jirayr R. Kembikian, a certified financial planner with Citrine Capital. #2: There's only one credit scoreWhile FICO is the most popular score provider, different types of lenders use different versions of the score. Plus, a growing number of lenders work with FICO competitors, such as VantageScore. ""There are many, many different credit scores out there, and the score that you just saw might not be the same one lenders see when they're examining your creditworthiness,"" said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree. Even if the scores are slightly different, they should trend in the same direction, Schulz added. So if one score drops significantly and the other does not, that could indicate a mistake or other issue in one of your credit reports.#3: It costs money to check your creditYou can get your credit reports from the three major credit agencies, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, every week for free at annualcreditreport.com. Most experts suggest checking your reports at least once per year to look for errors or evidence of identity theft, and federal law requires that the agencies allow you to do that for free. The credit agencies began offering weekly access to reports during the pandemic, but that could end soon.How long will it take to pay off my credit cards? ""One of the best ways to improve your credit score is to fix mistakes on your credit report,"" said Schulz. ""People would be surprised how often mistakes happen."" Credit reports do not include your score, but you can still get free access to certain scores through websites like LendingTree and Credit Karma, or through your credit card issuer.#4: Closing your old credit cards can boost your scoreThe length of your credit history is another factor that goes into your credit score.  So, keeping your oldest cards open, and occasionally using them (and paying them off) helps rather than hurts your score.Likewise, closing an account will damage your score. #5: Your spouse's score can impact yoursCredit scores are for individuals, not couples. While lenders will look at both of your scores if you apply for a joint credit card or mortgage, your scores are separate. So if your spouse has a low score, it won't affect any credit you apply for in your own name. #6: Opening a new card will hurt your creditAny new credit, including credit cards, will result in a short-term ding to your credit, but it won't affect your score long-term. It's the inquiry that the new lender performs that will likely take a few points from your score, but if you have good credit it should recover quickly. ""If you have several years of good credit behind you, you don't need to worry about opening a new card, as long as you're not planning to get a mortgage in the next few months,"" Pritchard said.#7: A higher income means a higher scoreWhile lenders will consider your income when deciding the size of a loan to give you, how much money you earn is not a factor that credit agencies use to determine your score. How much do I need for emergency savings? ""You can have someone with a lower income and an excellent credit score, and you can also have the opposite -- someone with a super high income and a terrible score,"" Kembikian said.#8: Co-signing on a loan won't affect your creditFrom a credit agency's point of view, co-signing a loan is the same thing as taking out a loan on your own. That loan balance will impact your credit utilization ratio, and late payments will hurt your credit score. ""If the person you're co-signing for is not responsible and doesn't pay their debt, for any reason, that can have a gigantic, negative impact on your credit score,"" Kembekian said."

","homes, As home values soar, the wealth gap grows even bigger  - CNN","As home values soar, the wealth gap grows","(CNN)Homeowners saw massive increases in wealth over the past decade, but most of the gains went to the wealthiest US households. As home prices soared, housing wealth increased by $8.2 trillion over a decade, rising to $24.1 trillion in 2020 from $15.9 trillion in 2010, according to a new report from the National Association of Realtors. But low- and middle-income households saw a smaller share of the gains. While a majority (71%) of the wealth accumulation went to high-income earners, middle-income households saw only 26%, and low-income households saw just 4%.Home prices skyrocketed last year. Two regions saw the biggest increasesIn addition, home prices have appreciated so rapidly in some metro areas that new low- and middle-income buyers are priced out of the market entirely.Phoenix saw the biggest price increase over the decade, that concluded at the end of 2021, with a 275% increase. It was followed by Atlanta; Las Vegas; Cape Coral, Florida; and the towns of Riverside and San Bernardino in California, all of which had increases of more than 200%.Read More""These escalating home values were no doubt beneficial to homeowners and home sellers,"" said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist. ""However, as these markets flourish, middle-income wage earners face increasingly difficult affordability issues and are regrettably being priced out of the home-buying process."" Benefits of homeownershipHomeownership is often the leading source of wealth among families, and its benefits can be powerful.""Owning a home continues to be a proven method for building long-term wealth,"" said Yun. ""Home values generally grow over time, so homeowners begin the wealth-building process as soon as they make a down payment and move to pay down their mortgage."" The Black homeownership rate is now lower than it was a decade agoFor example, if you bought a typical single-family home 10 years ago for the median price of $162,600, you're likely to have accumulated $229,400 in housing wealth, according to NAR. Though the middle-class homeownership rate fell overall, the number of middle-income homeowners increased in over half of the 917 metro areas in NAR's analysis. In order to determine which areas had a rising middle class, NAR looked for housing markets that had the greatest growth in middle income, owner-occupied homes between 2010 and 2020. Researchers defined a middle-class household as one earning an income of more than 80% to 200% of the area median income.The top 10 cities with increasing middle-income households during that decade were Phoenix; Austin; Nashville; Dallas; Houston; Atlanta; Orlando; Portland, Oregon; Seattle and Tampa. ""Middle-income households in these growing markets have seen phenomenal gains in price appreciation,"" said Yun. ""Given the rapid migration and robust job growth in these areas, I expect these markets to continue to see impressive price gains.""Challenges for middle- and low-income buyersBut there were also several large cities that saw a drop in middle-class households over the past decade. These include New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Detroit, and Philadelphia. In these and other cities where home prices are rapidly rising, middle- and low-income buyers have struggled to get into the market.Low-income homeowners comprised a smaller fraction of all homeowners in 2020, at just 27%, the NAR research found, down from 38% in 2010. How much house can I afford? While middle-income homeowners increased in number over the decade, they represented a smaller share of homeowners in 2020, at 43%, down from 45.5% in 2010. The share of high-income homeowners grew, rising to 30%, up from 16.4% in 2010. That is 11.1 million more high-income households in 2020 compared to 2010.""Homeownership is rewarding in so many ways and can serve as a vital component in achieving financial stability,"" said Leslie Rouda Smith, a real estate agent from Plano, Texas, and a broker associate at Dave Perry-Miller Real Estate in Dallas, who is the NAR President. ""Now, we must focus on increasing access to safe, affordable housing and ensuring that more people can begin to amass and pass on the gains from homeownership."""

But making sure you're taking full advantage of your 401(k), or any other employer-sponsored retirement account your job might offer, is one of the most important steps you can take for your future financial security.  That's because every dollar you sock away now in a 401(k) will be worth much more than dollars saved later, thanks to the magic of compounding. That's when the money earned from your investments starts to generate more earnings, allowing those early deposits to grow exponentially.""Even small amounts that you can save now have the power to grow substantially over 40 years,"" said Kara Duckworth, a certified financial planner and managing director of client experience for Mercer Advisors in Newport Beach, California. ""The earlier you start the better.""Read MoreFollow these steps to make sure you're making the most of this powerful tool:Contribute at least enough to get the company match (and boost your contributions over time)To motivate employees to save for retirement, many companies will match the money you contribute to your 401(k), up to a set amount.  Among employers who match a portion of retirement savings, the median employer contribution is 6% of an employee's salary, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. At a minimum, aim to save enough in your plan to get that match, since it's essentially free money from your employer and a 100% return on your investment.""The hardest thing about saving for retirement is just getting started,"" said Ben Barzideh, a wealth adviser at Piershale Financial Group in Barrington, Illinois. ""Once you set it up, very quickly after a few paychecks, you just get used to living on the new net amount, just as you do with taxes.""  You know your salary. But how much are you really making? Calculate your total compensationYou'll want to gradually increase the amount you save over time until you're at 10-15% of your income. One strategy for doing that is to boost your savings rate every time you get a raise, so you won't feel as much of a bite out of your paycheck. Build a diverse portfolio, with a focus on stocksMost 401(k) plans have several different diversified funds from which you can select. Diversification is important, since owning many different assets can protect you from swings in the price of any single investment. But when you're saving for a goal (like retirement) that's decades away, most advisers say you'll want more of your portfolio in stocks, which have historically performed better than most other asset classes over the long term.Not sure where to start? See if your plan offers a target-date fund, which will automatically build an appropriate portfolio for you based on your projected retirement age. The allocation will gradually shift away from stocks to more conservative investments, such as bonds, as your retirement date gets closer.Consider the Roth optionMost 401(k) plans now allow investors to choose whether they want to contribute to a traditional 401(k) or a Roth 401(k). 'Backdoor' Roth restrictions have been put on hold -- for nowContributions to a Traditional 401(k) go in tax-free and grow tax-free, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. For a Roth 401(k) contributions go in after-tax, but you'll owe no taxes on growth or future withdrawals.In general, the Roth option makes sense for those who think they'll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, either because they have more income or because tax rates have gone up. If you're not sure, splitting your contributions across the Roth and traditional 401(k) can provide you with more flexibility later.Take advantage of any other financial benefits your company offersIn addition to the 401(k), a growing number of companies now also offer a range of other financial benefits to employees, including student loan assistance, Health Savings Accounts, and one-on-one financial advice. Participate in as many of these programs as you can. ""For young people living paycheck to paycheck, there's no one-size-fits-all answer to managing your finances,"" said Edward Gottfried, director of product at Betterment's 401(k) business. ""Make sure your paycheck allows you to pay down your student loans while you're socking away money for retirement and continuing to stay on top of debt and month-to-month expenses.""How much do I need to save for retirement? Once you've addressed other financial challenges in your life, you can contribute more to your retirement account without worrying that you may need the money in the short term.Take it with you when you goWhile you're likely not yet thinking about your next step on the career ladder, most employees in today's economy change jobs several times throughout their working life. You have a few options for your 401(k) when you leave your job, including rolling it into an individual retirement account (IRA) or a 401(k) at your new employer. What will my take-home pay be? One option to avoid, if possible: cashing it out entirely. Withdrawing from a 401(k)  before you reach retirement age can result in tax penalties -- and leave you with a smaller nest egg in your golden years."

","success, How to manage your money amid global unrest - CNN",How to manage your money amid global unrest,"With Russia's internationally condemned invasion of Ukraine, one thing is certain: No one knows exactly how things will play out. So far that disturbing uncertainty hasn't sent markets into a sustained tailspin. US stocks took a hit the week of the invasion, but have since recovered some of those losses. But the market is likely to experience volatility as events unfold. ""It's hard to call this one,"" said Florida-based certified financial planner Mari Adam. ""We just don't know.""But if you've been concerned about whether the geopolitical turmoil might negatively affect your savings and investments, here are a few ways to assess your situation and guard against potential losses.Don't trade on the headlines Read MoreRapid-fire news reports about soaring energy and food prices or talk of a potential world war or nuclear attack are unnerving. Oil price shocks cause recessions. Will this one do the same?But history often shows that making financial decisions based on an emotional response to major events is often a losing proposition long term.""Making a radical change in the midst of all this uncertainty is usually a decision that [you'll] regret,"" said Don Bennyhoff, chief investment officer for Liberty Wealth Advisors and a former investment strategist at Vanguard.Look back at periods of war and other crises in the last century and you'll see that stocks typically came back faster than anyone might have expected in the moment, and did well on average over time.For example, since the financial crisis hit in 2008,  the S&P 500 returned 11% a year on average through 2021, according to data analyzed by First Trust Advisors. The worst year in that period was 2008, when stocks fell 38%. But in most of the years that followed, the index posted a gain. And four of its annual gains ranged between 23% and 30%.If you go back as far as 1926, that annual average return on the S&P has been 10.5%.  ""Staying the course may be hard on your nerves, but it can be healthiest for your portfolio,"" said Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning, retirement income and wealth management at Charles Schwab.That's not to discount the seriousness of nuclear threats and the chance that this period could diverge from historical patterns. But were things to truly escalate globally, Williams noted, ""we'd have more to be concerned about than our investment portfolios.""Instead of making changes based on your reaction to the latest events, first review your financial situation holistically.Cover your near-term cash needsIt's always a good idea, but especially when confronted with big events beyond your control, to make sure you have liquid assets for your most urgent needs.That means enough money set aside in cash, money market funds or short-term fixed income instruments to cover near-term tax payments, unexpected emergencies and any big, upcoming expenses (e.g., a down payment or tuition). This is also advisable if you are near or in retirement, in which case you may want to have enough liquidity to cover a year or more of the living expenses that you would ordinarily pay for with withdrawals from your portfolio, Williams said. This should be the amount you would need to supplement your fixed income payments, such as Social Security or a private pension. In addition, Williams suggests having two to four years in lower volatility investments like a short-term bond fund. That will help you ride out any market downturn should one occur and give your investments time to recover.Review your risk toleranceIt's easy to say you have a high tolerance for risk when the S&P 500 keeps setting record highs. But you have to be able to stomach the volatility that inevitably comes with investing  over time.So review your holdings to make sure they still align with your risk tolerance for a potentially rockier road ahead. And while you're at it, figure out what it means to you to ""lose"" money. ""There are many definitions of risk and loss,"" Bennyhoff said. What is a financial coach and who really needs one?For instance, if you're keeping money in a savings account or CD, any interest rate you're earning is likely being outpaced by inflation. So while you preserve your principal, you lose buying power over time. Then again, if it's more important to preserve principal over a year or two than risk losing any of it -- which could happen when you invest in stocks -- that inflation-based loss may be worth it to you because you're getting what Bennyhoff calls a ""sleep-easy return.""That said, for longer-term goals, figure out how much you feel comfortable putting at some risk to get a greater return and prevent inflation from eating away at your savings and gains.""Over time you're better off and safer as a person if you can grow your wealth,"" Adam said.Rebalance your portfolioGiven record stock returns in the past few years, now may be a good time to rebalance your portfolio if you haven't done so in a while. For instance, Adam said, you may be overweight in growth stocks. To help stabilize your returns going forward, she suggested maybe reallocating some money into slower-growing, dividend-paying value stocks through a mutual fund.Make new investments slowlyIf you have a large lump sum -- maybe you just sold your business or house, or you got an inheritance or big bonus -- you may wonder what to do with it now.Given all the global uncertainty, Adam recommends investing it in smaller chunks periodically -- e.g., every month for a given period of time -- rather than all at once. ""Space out your investing over time since this week's news will be different than next week's news,"" she said.Reassess assumptionsIn the months leading up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the expectation was that the Federal Reserve would be hiking interest rates multiple times this year to curb high inflation. Now? Maybe not as much. ""The near-term effects on the US economy of the invasion of Ukraine, the ongoing war, the sanctions, and of events to come, remain highly uncertain,"" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday. ""Given the current situation, we need to move carefully.""That could push government bond prices higher and rates lower, should investors seek US Treasurys as a safe haven on a sustained basis. And it could mean that interest rates on savings may not move as high as they might have when everyone expected the Federal Reserve would hike rates substantially this year.Do your best. Then 'let go'Keep in mind: It's impossible to make perfect choices since no one has perfect information.""Collect your facts. Try to make the best decision based on those facts plus your individual goals and risk tolerance."" Adam said. Then, she added, ""Let go.""(If you want to help Ukrainians who have had to flee or who stayed behind to fight, here's a growing list of organizations to which you can make a donation.)"

""Consequently, rates are expected to stay low in the short-term, but will likely increase in the coming months.""What will my monthly mortgage payment be?Experts and analysts had forecasted a fairly steady rise for mortgage rates this year, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine followed by severe economic sanctions has created uncertainty.Read More""Investors are concerned about the deepening Russia-Ukraine conflict and rising oil prices, and are wary of spillover effects from rising economic sanctions,"" said George Ratiu, Realtor.com's manager of economic research.He said that markets have their eyes on mounting inflation and an expectation that the Federal Reserve will proceed with a 25-basis-point hike at its upcoming meeting later this month.""Market volatility and rising oil prices are likely to push bond yields into larger swings, while inflation will keep upward pressure on mortgage rates,"" Ratiu said.Mortgage applications are fallingMortgage applications decreased during the last full week of February, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, partially in response to climbing rates.Applications for loans to purchase a home remained weak, said Joel Kan, MBA's associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting. Meanwhile, the average loan size increased again -- to a new record of $454,400 --  an indication that home prices are still rising and a greater share of mortgage activity is occurring at the higher end of the market, he said.Should I refinance my mortgage?""We will continue to assess the potential impact on mortgage demand from the sharp drop in interest rates this week due to the invasion of Ukraine,"" he said. Meanwhile, Ratiu said, real estate markets are seeing an early start to the spring buying season, with unseasonably high demand and record low inventory continuing to push home prices higher. ""At today's rate, the buyer of a median-priced home will pay over $278 per month more than a year ago on their mortgage payment,"" Ratiu said. ""Surging prices and higher rates are creating challenges for first-time buyers looking for a home, causing them to make difficult choices in light of higher monthly costs for food, gasoline, clothing, cars and health care."""

Do it in this order - CNN",Ready to start saving? Do it in this order,"One of the most important things you can do when it comes to securing your financial future is to consistently live below your means. Once you've done that, however, the next step is to take any leftover cash -- whether it's a few dollars or a few hundred dollars -- and put it to work. Experts agree that most people should have savings and investments in a variety of different types of accounts to save for various goals while taking advantage of certain tax benefits. Financial experts generally advise saving 10% to 15% of your income, but if that's not possible right now, start setting aside whatever you can and increase the amount over time. How much do I need to save for retirement? The exact order in which you save will depend on your personal financial picture and goals, but when you're first starting to build your savings, the goals are: Get into the habit of saving for the long-term, take advantage of free money available through your workplace benefits, and make the most of tax-free savings. To do that, here's where you'll want to focus your money:An emergency fundAim to set aside at least three months' worth of total living expenses in a safe, liquid account you can access without any penalties if you lose your job or have an unexpected expense, like your car breaks down or your roof starts leaking. An emergency funds is typically held in a savings or money market account. Read MoreHigh-interest debtsWhile it's technically not saving or investing, paying off high-interest debt should also be a top priority. ""I'd prioritize any debt with an interest rate over 10%,"" said Peter Hunt, a certified financial planner and director of client services at Exencial Wealth Advisors. ""That's a risk-free 10% return.""Your workplace 401(k), up to any employer matchMoney in your 401(k) account goes in tax-free and grows tax free until you take it out in retirement. Many employers match a percentage of employees' contributions up to a certain amount.""Depending on the matching schedule, [the company contributions could provide] an 80% to 100% return,"" Hunt said. ""You're not going to beat that anywhere else."" Contribute at least enough to get any employer match offered. If your employer does not have a match, you might want to focus first on paying down high-interest debt and building an emergency fund. What is a financial coach and who really needs one?A Health Savings AccountIf you have a high-deductible health plan through work, you might also have access to a health savings account. (High-deductible health plans are defined as those with a deductible of at least $1,400 for an individual or $2,800 for a family.) Money goes in tax-free, grows tax-free, and comes out tax-free if you use it for qualified medical expenses. ""On the tax merits alone, it's hard not to put the HSA at the top of the heap as the best tax-advantaged vehicle you could possible employ,"" said Christine Benz, director of personal finance at Morningstar.This year, you can put $3,650 into an HSA account if you have an individual high-deductible plan, and up to $7,300 if you have a family plan. Max out your 401(k) or other retirement savings accountsOnce you have your basic savings plans in order you can start really boosting your retirement savings. You can stash up to $20,500 in a 401(k) account. Even if you don't have access to a 401(k), you can still save money for retirement through an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), although the contribution limits are lower.""I think of retirement accounts as a use-it-or-lose-it opportunity every year,"" says Marcus Blanchard, a certified financial planner and founder of Focal Point Financial Planning. ""If you don't use it up to the limit, that's a lost opportunity for the year.""A liquid account for short-term savings goalsYou'll want to set aside money that you need in the next three to five years, such as for a home down payment or to pay for graduate school, in a safe account like a high-yield savings account or money market account, where the returns are low, but your principal is fairly safe.""In general, you want to save in short-term investment vehicles for short-term goals, and long-term investments for long-term goals,"" said certified financial planner Clark Kendall, who runs wealth management firm Kendall Capital in Baltimore, Maryland.  The best budgeting apps of 2022Lower-interest loansAgain, debt repayment is not technically saving or investing, but paying down debt like student loans or auto financing can improve your cash flow, boost your credit score, and give your more financial flexibility over time. A taxable brokerage accountIf you still have money left over after you've funded your short-term goals and you're on your way to your long-term objectives, you can take the next steps in investing. A taxable investment account is a great place to put cash when you've maxed out your retirement accounts. ""That's where you're investing for the long haul, for at least five years, but you have liquidity if you need it,"" says Lazetta Braxton, co-CEO of 2050 Wealth Partners. 529 college savingsIf contributing to your children's college education is important to you, a 529 account is a great vehicle for savings. Money invested grows tax free and can be withdrawn tax free as long as it's used for qualified education expenses. Just make sure you're on track for your own retirement and goals first.  Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the definition of a high deductible health plan for individuals. Individuals health plans with deductibles of at least $1,400 are considered to be high-deductible and are eligible for a Health Savings Account."

""Access to childcare has been shown time and again to boost labor force participation among mothers,"" the authors wrote. ""For employers struggling to find workers now and facing a future of dismal labor supply growth, improving childcare options for parents means a larger and more experienced workforce to draw upon.""Employment in the day care services industry remains 12.4% below its pre-pandemic level, as compared to a total employment deficit of 1.9%. By Wells Fargo's estimates, that leaves about 460,000 families scrambling to find reliable long-term child care.""It's not to say that all [460,000] of them are unable to work, but it means that they're going to have to find different child care arrangements, whether that's the higher cost of nannies, whether that's relying on families,"" Sarah House, Wells Fargo senior economist and lead author of the report, said in an interview with CNN Business. Read MoreChild care workers are vanishing and it's hurting the entire economy""And for some, it also means perhaps not being in the workforce the way that they have imagined if they can't find that access to child care,"" she added.Bearing the brunt of those challenges have been women, especially those with young children.Women with children younger than 3 years of age have a labor force participation rate that's 28 percentage points below men with children under 6 years old, House said, noting the federal employment data does not include men with children under 3 years of age. If the labor force participation rate for those women equaled that of women with school-aged children (ages 6 to 17 years old), the labor force would gain 1 million more workers, the report found. Additionally, no industry has a greater share of female employees than the day care services industry, where women account for 96% of workers, she said. While the child care and early education industry need more workers, some significant barriers persist, House said: notably, low pay and health risks associated with the ongoing pandemic.In 2020, the average pay for a child care worker was below $12.25 per hour, landing among the lowest paid occupations, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Last month, a report from the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment at the University of California, Berkeley, found that many child care industry employees in California earn below or near federal poverty wages, resulting in about one-third of these workers relying on some form of government assistance. ""For decades, low levels of public investment in this sector have kept the early care and education workforce -- largely women of color and immigrant women -- in a grim financial bind,"" the University of California, Berkeley researchers wrote.Direct federal spending on child care and early education totaled about $29.7 billion in 2021, up from $20.6 billion in 2019, according to the Wells Fargo report. The amount of federal child care spending in 2019 was less than 4% of spending by the Department of Defense and 3% of Medicaid and Medicare, the economists noted.Within the child care industry exists a ""pay paradigm,"" the report said: Child care is expensive for parents, yet the pay for workers and early educators is substandard, according to the report. Child care services cost, on average, $11,000 per year, or about 14% of the median household income for a family with a child under 6 years of age -- but the actual costs can run much higher. The average pay for a child care industry worker was about $25,060 in 2020. ""With tuition already demanding such a substantial share of family income, daycare centers are hard pressed to meaningfully raise pay,"" the authors wrote.Sweeping federal funding for child care has been proposed by President Joe Biden and included in the Build Back Better Bill passed by the House of Representatives in November. However, with that plan currently stalled, the $800 billion the bill proposes to spend over the next 10 years has been waylaid.One solution floated by House and her fellow economists is to treat the child care industry like public education: tax-funded K-12 systems, community colleges and universities.""But so much of this is past dependency in that we haven't done it in the past, so that makes it really hard to do it now,"" she said. It leaves the issue more in the hands of states, House said, adding that incremental process -- as opposed to wholesale change -- is more likely to occur.""[At the state level] is where the momentum lies, in terms of the policy experimentation and chances to try and expand access to early child care and education,"" she said."

The national median rent was $1,789 last month.""US rental markets are more than making up for lost time,"" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. Rents have now gone up 21% from January 2020, prior to the onset of the pandemic. January's biggest rent jump was in the Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach areas of Florida where the median rent was $2,895 a month in January, up 52.4% from last year. Miami is now the fifth most expensive place to rent in the country after several cities in California: San Jose, San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco.The report found that the monthly cost of buying a starter home was more affordable than renting a similar-sized unit in more than half of the 50 biggest US cities.Read MoreWhile many people looking for an affordable place to live feel stuck between a rock and a hard place as both rent and homebuying costs are rising, a number of factors could tip the affordability scale in favor of people buying a home for the first time this year, Hale said.Rents are forecast to outpace for-sale listing price growth in 2022 and are already accelerating across all sizes of rentals. Additionally, she said, survey data shows the majority of landlords plan to further raise the rents they ask this year. Where it's better to buyLooking at national median home prices and rents, the monthly cost of renting is still slightly cheaper than owning a starter home, the report found. But in 26 of the 50 biggest cities, the monthly cost of buying a starter home was an average of 20.6% -- or $323 -- less than renting one in January, according to Realtor.com.Buying was most advantageous in Birmingham, Alabama, where the cost of buying a starter home was 44.3% less than the cost of renting in January. It was followed by Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis. Should I rent or buy a home?Two cities in Florida -- Tampa and Orlando -- saw some of January's fastest annual rent growth. In Orlando, buying was 27.1% less than renting and in Tampa, buying was 25.5% less.Just because it is better to buy in a city doesn't mean home prices aren't also making strong gains -- often it is both. In eight of the top 10 markets favoring buying, both the monthly cost of buying a starter home and renting one increased over the past year, according to the report. The rent-or-buy decision ultimately depends on personal circumstances, including location, financial situation and how long a buyer intends to live in the home. Generally it is not financially favorable to buy if you plan to live in your home less than a few years and a common rule of thumb is to not spend more than 30% of your income on housing costs, Hale said.Plus, buying a home is a lot easier said than done in many markets, as the inventory of homes to buy is at a record low.And as mortgage rates continue climbing, the clock is ticking. Those looking to buy their first home in 2022 are more likely to find lower costs now than later in the year, said Hale. But inventory isn't expected to improve until later this spring.Where renting is betterGiven the skyrocketing increase in home prices in some major cities, there are many places where it remains more affordable to rent rather than to dive into the high-priced, competitive housing market, according to the report.In January, the monthly cost of buying was about 25% higher -- or $536 more -- than the cost of renting in 24 of the 50 largest metro areas, on average. How much house can I afford? Austin, Texas, was the city where it was most beneficial to rent rather than buy in January. Monthly payments were about 76% higher -- or $1,346 more -- to buy a starter home in Austin than to rent, according to the analysis. It was followed by New York; San Francisco; San Jose; Seattle; Boston; Denver; Rochester, New York; Portland, Oregon; and Los Angeles.In these top ten cities that favored renting, the monthly payments of buying a starter home were 41.6% -- or $978 higher than rents -- on average. For-sale starter homes in those places included a higher average share of condos than the national rate, and pricier home owner association fees. ""Deciding when to transition from renting to first-time buying is largely dependent on stage of life,"" said Hale. ""For young Americans like Gen Z who may have moved home to save money during Covid, renting in a big tech city offers flexibility and relative affordability even as rents recover in these areas."""

It has not been this high since May 2019 when it was at 3.99%.Mortgage rates jumped again because of high inflation and stronger than expected consumer spending, said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist. ""As rates and house prices rise, affordability has become a substantial hurdle for potential homebuyers, especially as inflation threatens to place a strain on consumer budgets,"" said Khater.How much house can I afford?

As a result, the share of applications that were refinances was at its lowest level since July 2019, Kan said, adding that refinance applications fell 9% last week and stood at around half of last year's pace. Applications for mortgages to purchase a home also saw a decline over the week, Kan said. ""Prospective buyers still face elevated sales prices in addition to higher mortgage rates,"" Kan said. The mix of more conventional loans has pushed the average loan size to yet another record of $453,000, he noted.Rising home prices combined with limited inventory have created a one-two-punch for buyers, with fewer homes affordable to buyers based on their income level, said Danielle Hale, Realtor.com's chief economist.That was the case even before mortgage rate increases, which have upped the monthly cost of the typical $375,000 home listing by roughly $115 since December, she said. ""Looking ahead, we expect rising incomes to help home shoppers navigate rising housing costs, but buyers will also likely have to make compromises to be successful,"" said Hale."

The December drop was revised even lower in Wednesday's report.US retail sales have been on a roller coaster over the past few months due to the unusual shopping patterns of this most recent holiday season and headwinds from the Omicron wave, said economists at Action Economics in a note to clients.On top of that, loosening supply chain constraints may have also helped: ""Some of the major gains in sales were thus made possible by people finally getting their hands on stuff they couldn't before,"" said Tim Quinlan and Shannon Seery, economists at Wells Fargo.Read MoreThe categories that registered stark declines at the end of last year posted strong gains in January. Online sales were particularly strong in January -- rising 14.5% after posting an 11.4% drop in December. Home furnishing stores and department stores also posted sizable gains at 7.2% and 9.2%, respectively.Sales at gas stations dropped 1.3% even as gas prices also fell by 0.8% in January, according to data released last week by the Labor Department. Americans may have been driving less in January as the Omicron wave prompted many to stay home and work remotely when possible.Retail therapy in the face of inflationConsumer prices nearly rose to a 40-year high in January.

And even though salary increases in many cases aren't keeping up with inflation, additional cash in people's wallets helps to drive spending.""Consumers say they are worried about inflation, but they continue to spend,"" said PNC chief economist Gus Faucher. ""Even taking into account the December decline, retail sales in recent months have been increasing much faster than prices, so households are purchasing larger volumes of goods and services, not just paying higher prices.""The January sales bump also calls into question the worries about potentially low consumer spending at the start of this year. Economists had worried that the Omicron variant might weigh on people's spending behavior. But that line of thinking needs revising now, the Wells Fargo economists said.That's good news for the recovery because the US economy needs consumer spending to grow.That said, higher prices do affect people's shopping choices: Consumers may not accept higher prices for much longer and will look to trade down to cheaper products or buy less altogether, say companies and analysts.""Eventually, it moves to another phase where there's inflation and a squeeze on the income,"" Coca-Cola (COKE) CEO James Quincey told analysts last week.

It's not clear yet whether this peak was reached in January or if it's still to come.But consumers are expecting some relief. Consumer expectations for price hikes in the year ahead fell for the first time since October 2020 last month, according to the consumer expectations survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released Monday. Over a three-year horizon, inflation expectations also fell, marking the largest one-month decline since 2013 when the survey was started.Where did prices rise?The PPI tracks prices for finished goods and services sold to consumers, as well as the goods, services, maintenance and repair construction sold to businesses that make or provide those finished products.In January, prices rose across the board, including for motor vehicles and equipment, gas, clothing and accessories, transportation and hospital outpatient care.How does inflation affect my standard of living?Last month's increase in energy costs won't get any better in February, said BMO senior economist Jennifer Lee in a note to clients.On Monday, US oil prices briefly rose to their highest level since 2014 amid heightened concerns about a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine.And even though oil prices fell early Tuesday, good inflation-related news is hard to come by.""An early look at February in one part of the country isn't bringing good news,"" Lee said, referring to the New York state manufacturing index that was released at the same time as PPI and sharply underperformed expectations.The high inflation has also been a challenge for Washington. President Joe Biden and administration officials have acknowledged how tough higher prices are for Americans.""The President will continue to make progress on his three-part plan of addressing supply chain disruptions; lowering kitchen tables costs with his Build Back Better agenda; and promoting more competition,"" a White House official told CNN Business Tuesday.For the Federal Reserve, which is tasked with keeping prices stable, Tuesday's report just reiterated that inflation is running too hot and that it's time to adjust monetary policy.The Fed started to wind down its pandemic stimulus programs late last year and signaled in January an intent to raise interest rates at its March meeting. Market expectations are slightly skewed towards a half percentage point rate hike, according to the CME FedWatch Tool."

The S&P 500 fell by more than 5% in January, its worst performance since the pandemic began, and markets remained choppy through the first two weeks of February. Experts expect the volatility to continue going forward, amid concerns about inflation and rising interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty, and the ongoing pandemic. ""There are a lot of headwinds,"" said Craig Ferrantino, founder of Craig James Financial Services in Melville, New York. ""Some of it is temporary, but some of it might take a long while to clear out. There is a lot of economic uncertainty.""Market volatility can be a good thing for long-term investors who dollar-cost average -- meaning they contribute regularly to their investment accounts over time -- since it allows them to hedge their risk by buying stocks at both the highs and lows, smoothing out the returns.But recent market performance has some investors anxious about a potential correction, during which the market falls by 10% or more from recent highs. Read More""For the average retirement investor who doesn't have an adviser reminding them during the upcycles that there is going to be a correction, it can be a scary time,""  said Deborah Meyer, a certified financial planner and CEO of WorthyNest. ""That's especially true for you millennials who haven't been through a market crash before.""If you're worried about your investments, take a deep breath and then follow these steps:1. Take money you need in the short-term out of the marketExperts advise against keeping any money you will need in the next five years (or sooner) out of the stock market entirely and moving it into safer investments like a high-yield savings account or a money-market fund. That includes your emergency fund, as well as cash you've set aside for near-term goals like a down payment on a home, or renovation or wedding. Interest rates are rising. Here's what to do if you're investing in bondsIf you're retired or nearing retirement and you plan to draw on your portfolio for everyday costs, consider moving up to two years' worth of expenses out of the stock market.""So long as you know your liquidity needs are met, you can let your portfolio do its thing, and you will weather through any potential recession,"" said Nancy Hetrick, founder and CEO of Smarter Financial Solutions.2. Stick to your plan for longer-term investmentsFor longer-term investments, remind yourself what you're saving for. If you're putting money aside for a retirement that's decades away, for example, or college tuition for your toddler, you have plenty of time for your investments to recover from any dips or even a correction. The reason most advisers recommend that long-term investors keep the bulk of their money in a diversified portfolio with a heavy allocation to stocks is that volatility and short-term risk allows for higher returns over time. But you should determine what allocation is best for you based on your time horizon and personal risk tolerance.Quit your job? Here's what to do with your 401(k) ""Even the biggest firms can't time the market in the short term,"" said Anthony Mezzasalma, a certified financial planner with Mezzasalma Advisors. ""The way to get around that is to have a plan and make sure that the money we're taking risks with is invested for the long-term.""Having a pre-determined asset allocation (and determining which circumstances would justify you making changes to it) allows you to avoid making emotional decisions about your investments when volatility hits. The longer you can remain invested in the market, the more time you'll have for your investment gains to compound, negating the impact of day-to-day market movements. 3. Make sure you have realistic expectationsEven with the short bear market that hit at the start of the pandemic, investors have enjoyed record performance in recent years. The S&P 500 is up nearly 60% over the past three years. It's easy to forget that historically speaking, annual returns hover closer to 10%, and that bear markets (pullbacks of 20% or more) hit, on average, once every two to three years. That means that expecting your investments to continue to perform as they have over the past three years is not realistic.""Even if you know that volatility is normal, it can be a very visceral experience when we see our wealth vanish,"" said Donald Calcagni, chief investment officer with Mercer Advisors. ""But it comes back to having a plan, and sticking to it."""

New leases with concessions, like one or two months of rent knocked off a yearlong lease, dropped from 41% a year ago to just 20% in February. Buying is more affordable than renting in these citiesThe last time the net-effective rent was that high was in April 2020, at $3,540 a month, after the pandemic's onset but before the bottom fell out of the rental market. But the amount tenants paid in February was 7.1% higher than pre-pandemic rent in February 2020.Prices are rising across the board as many New York City businesses return to in-person work, boosting demand.A year ago, roughly 1% of new apartments leased at a rent higher than listed because of a bidding war, said Miller, which is close to a typical rate. But, in February, 18% of Manhattan apartments rented for more than the asking price.Short supply of apartments to rentThe inventory of rental apartments, which glutted the borough during the pandemic, dropped 81% in February from the year before. The vacancy rate, which was above 11% a year ago, dropped to just 1.32%. ""It isn't an all-time record low in vacancy, but it is the lowest February since the financial crisis,"" said Miller. February is typically one of the softest months for rentals, said Hal D. Gavzie, executive manager of leasing at Douglas Elliman. ""And there was no inventory. We're hoping there is some inventory opening up.""Should I rent or buy a home?Gavzie said many renters are facing a dilemma: accept a rent increase or find a new apartment.""Renters knew going into this that their concessions would end,"" said Gavzie. ""You knew you'd be able to take advantage of the deep discounts -- in some cases discounts of 40%, 50% and lock in for a year or two.

","success, Why this tax season is extra frustrating - CNN",Why this tax season is extra frustrating,"Confusion. Amnesia. New paperwork. Delays getting through to the IRS.These are some of the top pandemic-induced frustrations marking this tax filing season, both for tax preparers and their clients. A recent survey by the National Association of Tax Professionals found that ""only 4% [of tax preparers] think that taxpayers are knowledgeable about the tax law changes, which means longer conversations with their clients and chasing down documents needed to file their return.""Stimulus payments create a paper chaseThe IRS recently mailed letters to taxpayers that report how much a filer received in the third round of stimulus payments, which the agency started sending out in March 2021. Read More""Absolutely no one remembers getting it,"" said Texas-based enrolled agent Tynisa Gaines.And by ""it"" Gaines doesn't just mean the letter, but the actual payment itself. She attributes it to the stress of the past two years. ""People have blocked out 2020 and 2021.""Working remotely in a different state than your employer? Here's what that means for your taxesEven though many don't recall it, her clients who were eligible had gotten both the payment and the letter, Gaines said. But she only can establish that after sending her clients on a treasure hunt. If they lost their letter, she tells them to use the IRS portal to retrieve information on their stimulus payments. For some, that process has proven too difficult or time consuming. So she then asks them to comb through their bank records for proof the stimulus money was deposited in their accounts last year.Providing proof of actual payment and reporting the exact dollar amount is critical if the taxpayer doesn't want the IRS system to flag their return for a discrepancy, which could delay them getting their refunds for weeks or months, Gaines said. On the bright side, she noted, clients whose returns were completed and filed electronically have gotten their refunds well within the 21-day window the IRS promises. Reconciling child tax credit payments is even more frustratingConfusion and aggravation are even greater when it comes to another letter the IRS mailed recently reporting how much eligible taxpayers were sent in advanced child tax credit payments. The payments began going out monthly in July 2021. Normally parents get up to $2,000 per child and they see that money when they file their tax return the following year -- either as a refund or as a dollar-for-dollar reduction of what they still owe the IRS. But this year, when they file their 2021 returns, they already are likely to have received the first half of their credit -- which was temporarily increased to a maximum of $3,600 for children under 6 and $3,000 for children ages 6 through 17. So they will only be able to claim the second half of it when they file. That will possibly result in a smaller refund or less of a reduction in the taxes owed than many parents are used to. Brace for a smaller tax refund if you got monthly child tax credit payments in 2021Adding more complexity, the advanced payments were calculated based on the filer's income from a prior year, so they must reconcile on their tax return whether they were paid too much or too little based on their actual 2021 income.Louisiana-based enrolled agent Skip Touchet is worried some people will be ""shocked"" once they figure out what they're getting or not. In particular, he worries about those who decided early in 2021 -- before anyone knew they would be getting advanced payments -- to decrease their tax withholdings. By doing so, they received bigger paychecks during the year with the understanding they would get less of a refund or a slightly bigger tax bill at tax time.They may find, though, they will owe more money than expected because they reduced their tax withholdings for last year and now can only claim the second half of their child tax credit. Some parents, however, decided to opt out of getting the advanced payments through the IRS portal last year. But each spouse had to do it separately, which is not exactly intuitive for most married couples filing jointly. That's another reason why, all told, reconciling the advanced child tax credit issues ""has been a nightmare,"" said California-based enrolled agent Laura Strombom.Reaching the IRS takes an extra long timeGetting through to the IRS has also been a major hurdle this tax season. The agency is already contending with a backlog of matters related to 23 million returns and is understaffed.Don't panic if you got a scary IRS noticeTouchet says he often starts calling early in the morning. On a good day -- which he estimates is 25% of the time -- he will get through to someone on the hotline for tax professionals but only after waiting an hour or more. The wait for taxpayers reaching out on their own is often much longer. Gaines said she has a client who was told by the IRS that she owed $10,000 because she had not paid taxes on her pension. Except that she did. The client can't get through to anyone to address the problem. Now, Gaines said, ""We don't want to file her 2021 return [yet] because she has a refund [coming] and they'll probably take it to pay what she doesn't owe."" Tax preparers bear the brunt of frustrationThe added frustrations of this tax season mean more clients are barking at the messenger.""We're getting squeezed between the clients and the IRS,"" Touchet said.Robin Rae Huntley, an enrolled agent in Florida, summed things up more bluntly. In early February she said, ""I've filed 59 returns and been yelled at by at least 50 of [the clients]."""

Painfully high inflation has become the nation's number one economic problem, ignited by the pandemic, and set to get worse as Russia's invasion of Ukraine sends gasoline prices higher. In his State of the Union address, President Biden proposed several steps to address the inflation problem, and the Federal Reserve is on high alert. But there is no immediate fix, as neither the President nor the Fed have the appropriate tools to prevent prices from rising higher. Even worse: there is the growing threat that rising inflation will overwhelm the nation's strong economic recovery, resulting in a recession.  Inflation is as high as it has been in nearly 40 years. Because of the quickly rising prices, the typical American household, which makes less than $70,000 a year, needs to spend about $275 more a month, or $3,330 a year, to purchase the same goods and services they did last year, according to my own analysis. Fanning the higher inflation is the pandemic, and the severe disruption it has caused to global supply chains and the workforce with the millions of people it has made sick and unable to work or fearful of going to work. And, as the pandemic fades, so too eventually will the uncomfortably high inflation. But this won't happen next month or even this summer. Unscrambling the global economic mess created by the pandemic won't be easy, and it will take a couple years to see inflation come back down to a level we feel comfortable with.Russia's invasion of Ukraine complicates things further, ensuring the pain of inflation is set to get worse and last even longer. Global oil prices have risen dramatically since the invasion began to more than $110 per barrel. Even though global supplies have not been significantly disrupted by the Russian invasion, there is a considerable threat that they will be. The higher prices we're seeing are a premium oil traders add to oil prices to compensate for this risk. If supplies are significantly disrupted, then we could see oil prices rise to more than $140 per barrel and gas prices rise to more than $5 per gallon.Read MoreBut even assuming there are no supply disruptions, and oil settles in near $100 per barrel, then American consumers will still be paying more than $4 for a gallon of regular unleaded by this spring, according to my own estimate. If sustained, $100-a-barrel oil would ultimately add as much as half a percentage point to year-over-year consumer price inflation, based on simulations of Moody's Analytics' model of the global economy, which accounts for the impact of higher oil prices on the production and transportation of goods. That would cost American households another $50-plus per month in higher gasoline bills. Also worrisome is that oil and gasoline prices play an outsize role in shaping the inflation expectations of global investors, businesses and consumers. Most of us purchase gas regularly and see the price each day as we go to and from work. Nothing influences people's thinking about future inflation more than what they are paying at the pump today.If inflation expectations start to rise, then the Federal Reserve will likely feel compelled to raise interest rates more aggressively. The Fed knows that if inflation expectations increase, then this may ignite a so-called wage-price spiral. That is, workers will demand their employers pay them more to compensate for the expected increase in their cost of living, businesses will agree to do so as they will feel they can pass the higher cost along to their customers, and so it goes. The economy is recovering fast. But we need to ensure it works for everyoneThe last time this happened in the 1970s and early 1980s, it ended very badly, with a weakened economy suffering double-digit inflation — or stagflation. The only way to break the wage-price spiral was for the Fed to jack up interest rates and push the economy into recession. Even before the Russian invasion, global investors had been anticipating the Fed to increase rates as many as seven times this year in an effort to stem inflation. This would be difficult for the economy to adjust to, but doable. However, if the Fed hikes rates any further than that, it would meaningfully increase the odds that the economic recovery will falter. President Biden has ordered that oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) be released to help quell higher oil prices. Allies in Europe and Asia are taking similar action, which will provide an additional 60 million barrels to global markets. While this is the right thing do, as the SPR is supposed to be used in crises like the current one, it is much too little to have an impact on prices. The world consumes about 100 million barrels of oil a day. Criticism that the administration's efforts to address the threat posed by climate change is significantly contributing to the higher oil prices are specious. To be sure, the administration is working to make fossil fuel production less economically attractive and green energy investments more, but this will play out over years and decades. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is wrenching to watch as it inflicts an enormous toll on the Ukrainian people. Hopefully, for their sake there is a resolution soon. It is also critical to ensure that our high inflation recedes and economic recovery remains intact."

When I started my career in the late 1990s, only six women had ever broken the proverbial glass ceiling to become CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. This small but mighty group was an inspiration to young women like me just starting their careers, especially considering the uphill battle we faced when it came to gender equality (at the time, women earned 77 cents for every dollar earned by men).Last year, the number of women running businesses on the Fortune 500 hit a record of 41. And while I'm proud to be one of the women who lead billion-dollar brands, there still aren't enough of us. The tide has turned, but we still have a long way to go.Businesses can play a key role in supporting women, and some have already taken action to create a culture and business that prioritizes them. Now, it's time for all companies to work on leveraging these opportunities (and finding new ones) to be a catalyst for change.Establish equal pay for womenYou've likely heard the statistics before, but the pill never gets easier to swallow: Today, on average women earn 82 cents for every dollar a man earns. The wage gap is even greater for some, especially mothers and women of color. Read MorePaying women in the workplace fairly shouldn't be an innovative approach to doing business. It must be basic table stakes for any company.While independent data validation helps ensure transparency and unbiased results, companies of any size can institute an internal assessment that determines pay equity, helping build inclusive workplaces where everyone is given an equal opportunity to succeed.  Create equitable supply chains About 190 million women work in the global supply chain industry. Many women garment workers live and work in countries that have constrained social safety nets in place, which often means limited access to education and health care — both of which play key roles in enabling upward personal and professional mobility. While there has been enormous focus in the apparel sector on this topic over the last decade, there remains significant work to be done. For the past 15 years, Gap Inc. has combatted this disparity head-on through its Personal Advancement & Career Enhancement (P.A.C.E.) program, which provides women in the global apparel industry and surrounding communities with foundational life skills, technical training and support to advance in their personal and professional lives. Since the program was established, more than 35 partners have rolled out P.A.C.E. to their own supply chains, including PVH Corp., Hasbro and New Balance. More than 1 million women and girls have participated in Gap Inc.'s program across 17 countries where our clothes are made, giving women a voice and an opportunity to positively change the trajectory of their lives and their family's lives.Companies must invest in evaluating their suppliers and establish a clear methodology to assess how they treat and promote women. For instance, a company could require their factories to achieve gender parity at supervisor levels by a certain year. They could also work with community-based organizations that seek to address root causes of gender inequities. A comprehensive, holistic approach to women's empowerment — one that includes aligning a company's values with its sourcing decisions — can meaningfully move the needle on systemic gender-based issues that are prevalent in global supply chains. Elevate women-owned brandsAccording to the Women's Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC), 42% of all businesses in the US are women-owned. But they don't see the same revenue or investments that businesses owned by men do.Retailers have a unique opportunity to increase the visibility of women-owned brands by intentionally sourcing and promoting them. For instance, clean-beauty retailer Credo recognized the significant gender gap that exists in beauty brands' leadership teams. To bring attention to this disparity, Credo publicly shares the percentage of women-owned products it carries. Today, 90% of the brands Credo carries are from companies led by women founders or CEOs, compared with only 29% at conventional beauty stores. The female-founded company also recently announced the launch of its Credo for Change Workshop, which works to advance BIPOC-led (Black, indigenous and people of color) clean beauty brands with education, mentorship and funding opportunities to take their business to the next level.  Major retailers are showing support, too. Kroger, Walgreens and Walmart showcase items from women-owned brands on their websites, and Target is displaying a digital badge alongside products that have been certified by the WBENC as at least 51% owned, operated and controlled by women.Seek partnerships that support women Selecting the right partners is key to making sure that a company's mission and values are carried out. And when that mission is centered around women, those long-term meaningful relationships will not only push the business to do better, but it will make significant strides in ensuring women are supported and have the same opportunities as men.Best Buy founder: What every US college should teach their studentsAs part of Athleta's growth strategy, it has partnered with Allyson Felix, Simone Biles and Alicia Keys to not only collaborate on traditional product offerings, but also advise on and amplify initiatives like the Power of She Fund, which was established in 2020 to provide grants aimed at recognizing female empowerment. In partnership with Allyson, Simone and Alicia, the Fund has collectively awarded more than $1.4 million to more than 50 organizations to date, positively impacting more than 10,000 women and girls.Now more than ever, women are leading the charge in economic and social issues, and the business community's commitment to empowering women remains vital to closing the gender equity gap.Brands must use their platform and scale to support programming and strategies that help women thrive. All women deserve to reach their full potential and feel empowered to use their voice for good. Strategically investing in women is not only good for their personal and professional growth, it's also good for business. Ensuring pay equity, creating equitable supply chains, prioritizing female representation across female-driven industries — particularly in management — and seeking strategic partnerships that support women will help create a new cycle of lifting other women as we climb. All leaders — CEOs, managers, small business owners and beyond — must invest in the financial, physical, mental and emotional well-being of women. Investing in women is an investment for all, because when a woman is empowered, she lifts up other women, their families and their communities to build a more equitable and just world."

The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. 




Over the past several months, consumer prices have risen across the board, especially for basic needs like food, gas and shelter. And low- and middle-income families are getting hit the hardest. Not only do they spend a larger share of their income meeting basic needs, they tend to have less savings to help cushion the blow of higher prices. Reestablishing last year's now-expired enhanced child tax credit (CTC) — including paying the credit as a monthly benefit and providing the full benefit to low-income families — could provide significant assistance to families struggling to make ends meet. The American Rescue Plan temporarily increased the child tax credit from $2,000 per child under age 17 to $3,000 per child ages 6 to 17 and $3,600 per child under age 6. It also made advance payments of the credit available, so that from July to December, the families of about 61 million children received monthly payments of up to $250 per older child and $300 per younger child in advance of filing their tax return (and these families can now claim the second half of their CTC by filing a 2021 tax return). Most significant for low-income families, the credit was made fully refundable, which for the first time allowed even very low-income families to receive the full amount of the credit. The Build Back Better Act called for extending the credit for at least one more year, but the legislation has been stalled. Prioritizing an extension in the coming weeks can equip families to withstand rising prices.A key advantage of providing tax credits as opposed to other benefits, such as food stamps (or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits), is that the payments are unrestricted — families can use them to best meet their own needs. Several studies show that providing cash to families can provide stability and improve overall health and well-being. And that's exactly what the enhanced tax credits did. Shortly after the monthly payments began, food insecurity for families with children dropped by more than one quarter. Families reported using their monthly payments to purchase food, clothing and utilities — and over one-third of very low-income families used the payments for rent. Read MoreFamilies with children were also able to use the advance payments to improve their financial outlook. About half of families with incomes below $75,000 used the credits to pay off debt. Higher-income families were less likely to do the same, but over one-third of Black and Hispanic households with incomes over $75,000 also used the credit to pay down debt. Soaring gas prices are hurting Americans. It's time for more stimulus checksIn some cases, recipients of the tax credit have also reported that the payments helped them to work by giving them the means to pay for child care. This can include care that supports nontraditional work schedules, which can be difficult to get using existing subsidy programs. In other cases, some parents with young children reported working less and providing more direct care because of the expanded CTC. The temporary expansion of the child tax credit increased income support for millions of households with children, including those with very low incomes. But now that the payments have ended, child poverty has shot up by 41%. This effect is being exacerbated by the highest rate of inflation since the early 1980s, putting extra pressure on low-income households who just lost a key source of financial support. With the credit ending just as prices started rising, it is possible that some gains to family well-being in late 2021 will be lost to higher prices.Thanks to data from last year, we know that bringing back the enhanced CTC would reduce child poverty and provide crucial cash support to low-income households, without much interruption to work as some fear. Add to that the potential for the credit to blunt the harm of high inflation, and reinstating last year's child tax credit enhancements couldn't come at a better time."

Rising inflation is hitting all sectors of the economy. The overall rate of inflation on an annual basis reached 7.5% at the end of January, the highest level since 1982. Gas prices, in particular, are rising especially fast, reaching $4.25 a gallon on Wednesday, up from about $2.86 per gallon last March. That means filling a 20-gallon tank right now costs $85, up from $57.20 last year at this time.  A recent report by Moody's Analytics estimated that inflation was costing the average household $276 more per month, or about $1,100 per quarter. And given the instability in oil markets over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it wouldn't be surprising if those costs increased to more than $300 a month. Many Americans, especially those who are low- and moderate-income, can't afford to absorb such rapid price increases.Unfortunately, the federal government has limited tools to directly help families cope with rising gasoline prices and the overall increase in inflation. The administration could create a new program to help lower-income families pay for the high price of gasoline, raise interest rates to slow the economy, increase pressure on OPEC nations to increase petroleum production and find ways to ease supply chain disruptions. While all of these actions could help, they would take time to work their way through the economy and slow the growth of inflation. Families need help now.  The fastest and most effective way to protect vulnerable citizens from the impacts of global economic instability is to provide a direct payment through the IRS, similar to the three stimulus checks that were sent to families during the height of the pandemic. Those checks helped low- and moderate-income households when schools and child care programs were closed and companies were laying off workers.  But unlike the stimulus checks, these payments should be targeted directly to low- and moderate-income families, or those earning less than 80% of the national median income. That way, the checks reach those in greatest need while also limiting the total cost of the program.  Read MoreWhat Russia's invasion of Ukraine could mean for the US economic recoveryThe administration should ask Congress to authorize a payment of $1,100 per household to pay for four months of higher prices going forward, and provide an option for the president to provide a second or even third check to low-and-moderate income families for an additional four months in the event that prices remain high. We don't know when this crisis is going to end or when prices for essential goods and services will return to more affordable levels.  As the US government works to lower inflation through longer-term solutions, like monetary policy and loosening up supply-side constraints, this stimulus will help low- and moderate-income families afford necessities in the short term. And for those concerned that additional stimulus checks may exacerbate inflation, consider the perspective of a parent trying to afford food or medicine for their children, or buy gasoline to drive them to school or take an ailing grandparent to the doctor. If the government leaves them behind to face these inflationary pressures on their own, they will have to make tough decisions between paying for gasoline and other essentials, like food, medicine or heating.   Of even greater importance, helping families afford higher prices will send a message to the global community that the US will stand behind its citizens, especially those who are least able to pay the higher costs of rising prices on their own."

Millions of Americans are losing out on the chance to reap the benefits of homeownership because of a supply shortage. This shortage is most acute among affordable homes, where low- and moderate-income renters, younger first-time homebuyers, and people of color are losing faith that they will be able to experience this part of the American dream. We must do better. The US is in need of roughly 3.8 million to 5.5 million housing units. Building more homes for low- and moderate-income families and first-time homebuyers, and equipping these families with reliable and affordable financing tools so they can compete to buy these homes, is essential if we're to solve the nation's affordable homeownership crisis. In many respects, this crisis was born during the Great Recession. The per-capita rate of new production of single-family homes plummeted in the mid-2000s and has remained at about half that of the preceding four decades. This deficit quietly accumulated even as Millennials, who initially delayed homeownership in the aftermath of the financial crisis, began to enter the market. Then came Covid-19. Low interest rates and quarantines stoked housing demand while labor and materials shortages and supply chain challenges slowed construction and increased costs. Land prices and development costs are also rising in many parts of the country. The result is an environment in which developers are discouraged from building smaller, more affordable homes in favor of high-end homes that can absorb these increased costs while still returning a profit. Meanwhile, many existing home sellers are flooded with generous cash offers, often from investors, and are discouraged from accepting offers from typical first-time buyers who need more time to arrange for and obtain a mortgage. Expect markets to be on a wild ride until the Fed really starts raising ratesPast experiences can provide valuable lessons about how to address this crisis. After World War II, the federal government, recognizing ""an unprecedented emergency shortage of housing,"" made a number of moves, including limiting non-residential construction, removing import tariffs on lumber for building houses, and requiring allocation of building supplies for housing production for a period of time. At the same time, the government enabled families to buy homes with low-down payment, fixed rate, long-term amortizing mortgages facilitated by government guarantees, spurring the demand for new construction of such homes. From 1950 to 1959, an estimated 15 million new homes were built and the homeownership rate rose from 43.6% in 1940 to 61.9% in 1960.Read MoreThe strategy was flawed, however, because the homes and the beneficial financing were largely restricted to White households. Layers of federal and local policies effectively excluded people of color from the opportunity to become homeowners, inequities that have greatly contributed to our current racial homeownership gap. Today, 72% of White households own their home, as compared to 42% of Black households, 48% of Hispanic households and 58% of Asian American and Pacific Islander households. This is unacceptable. The government was correct to treat the housing shortage as an emergency after WWII, and we must rekindle that same urgency today. But we must also consider who we are building homes for. Here are a few ways that we can begin to address the housing shortage:Incentivize new construction of affordable homesFinancial incentives can encourage builders to build new homes that are within reach for many first-time buyers. Possible incentives run the gamut, from federal supports and subsidies, to better terms on construction lending, to fewer local regulations and restrictions that significantly add to building costs. Lift condo lending restrictionsConstruction of condominiums, which are a potential stepping stone for first-time buyers, is at record lows. State- and local government- and federal government-sponsored agencies' restrictions on condo lending presents a big barrier to first-time buyers who need a loan, and in turn to the development of for-sale condominiums. Focus on manufactured housingManufactured, modular, panelized and precut homes are a key piece of the puzzle. Built entirely or partially in factories and assembled on site, these various forms of prefabricated dwellings are an attractive solution because they cost less to produce than homes built on-site.  Before 1995, roughly 240,000 manufactured homes shipped annually, compared to less than 100,000 annually now. Similarly, modular, panelized and precut homes constituted 7% of new single-family homes in the 1990s compared to just 3% today. The Urban Institute estimates we could add 200,000 units of new, affordable housing annually by increasing production in these areas. Expanded zoning and building code flexibilities can help spur the creation of manufactured housing. Improve financing for existing homesWithin our existing housing stock are millions of affordable but older homes that need repair. Many people in the market for an affordable home can't just buy a house and repair it because of the way mortgage financing works. Most lenders will only lend against the property's current value, which does not allow enough for the needed repairs. As a result, a potential homebuyer may lose the chance to buy the home to investors and corporations that can afford to buy homes in bulk, finance the repairs, and then rent out the property, prohibiting the property from returning to the market as an affordable home for purchase. The big reason the US and UK are facing such a massive labor shortageLenders, the Federal Housing Administration and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can improve terms of financing for purchase/rehab loans, which can help unlock this potential supply by enabling new owners to buy, fix up and live in these homes.Another path to get preserved housing stock into the hands of owner-occupants is to simply update homes before they go on the market, so that would-be owners don't have to wrangle the financing and construction. In many places, community-based developers are bridging this gap with local subsidies or by acquiring foreclosed properties on preferential terms, enabling them to prioritize offers from buyers who plan to live in the home. Empower borrowersNone of these measures will succeed at increasing stable, affordable homeownership if we don't also empower households with better financing tools. Mortgage credit has remained excessively tight since the Great Recession, locking out many solid potential first-time buyers. Government and federal government-sponsored agencies should consider easing financing restrictions generally. Specifically, enabling more small balance mortgages, those under $100,000, with underwriting flexibilities, simplified processes and reduced fees and costs, will help many low- and middle-income families obtain modest homes. Down payment assistance, particularly for first-generation homebuyers, will also provide low-wealth families with a much-needed start on the path to homeownership.  Data shows that at this very moment, there are millions of renters, low- and moderate-income households, and people of color who meet the criteria to secure a mortgage. They've done the hard work of positioning themselves to become homeowners. Now we need to do our part by making sure that there are houses for them to buy and reliable financing tools to do so."

Over the past 12 months, US consumer prices rose by 7.5%, the highest rate in nearly 40 years. Worse, inflation is showing no signs of slowing.The Federal Reserve typically fights inflation by raising interest rates, which slows the economy by reducing the demand for goods and services. Ideally, the rate increases are sufficient to slow inflation without leading to a recession. But the problem is that the Fed cannot precisely control the rate of economic growth. So with the central bank expected to raise rates next month, barring a major impact on the US economy from the war in Europe, the question remains: Can the Fed contain inflation without triggering a recession? While we probably won't see a downturn this year, a recession next year is becoming increasingly likely, for a number of reasons.First, there is typically a lag between an interest rate hike and its economic effect. Some estimates suggest that it takes one to two years for the impact of monetary policy to peak. While the Fed is likely to start raising rates in March, most of its hikes are likely to occur in the second half of this year. That means that the negative economic impact will be much stronger in 2023 than in 2022. Second, the in-person services sector, hard-hit by the pandemic, is likely to continue its rapid growth through 2022. Spending on things like restaurants, hotels, entertainment, public transportation, hairdressers, gyms and many other consumption categories may not fully recover in 2022, but the receding fear of the pandemic will spur strong growth. Read MoreThat may sound like good news, but most of the positive impact of the recovery of in-person services will trail off by early 2023. Spending on these services will have normalized by then, just as the higher interest rates pack their strongest wallop.  Why inflation is about to peakWhat's more, a strong recovery in in-person services this year will also fuel the demand for workers, which we at the Burning Glass Institute expect to grow by about 4 million during 2022. We expect that to lower the unemployment rate from 4% now to below 3% in early 2023. This low unemployment will sustain wage pressures, which will continue to feed inflation. In the second half of 2022, the Federal Reserve may find that, despite its early interest rate hikes, inflation is not coming down much. The Fed's hard-earned credibility on containing inflation will erode. With pressure to contain inflation mounting, it may raise interest rates faster than it currently predicts, and further depress economic growth in 2023.Far from receding with the pandemic, the labor shortage will become the new normal. Pandemic-related factors such as the drop in immigration, early retirements and lower labor force participation among working-age people combined with long-running underlying trends have radically reduced the US labor supply. In 2020, for example, the working-age population of the US started shrinking, driven by longer-term factors like the baby boomer generation aging and retiring. In addition, women's labor force participation rate stopped growing, while that of men and young adults have declined dramatically even before the pandemic. The fact is that labor shortages are not going anywhere. Would the Fed's interest rate hikes be enough to set off a 2023 recession? That's not yet clear, but it is a real possibility. What is certain is that the dwindling labor supply is becoming a serious constraint on US economic growth."

He specializes in energy and housing affordability and related finance issues. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. 




Energy is an essential component of our day-to-day lives. We use it to cook our food, stay warm in the winter and cool our homes in the summer. But home energy prices have risen during the pandemic while more people are struggling to just get by. For too long, lower-income American families have been forced to choose between paying their home energy bill and paying for food, medicine and other essentials. That's hopefully about to change. On Thursday, Senator Ed Markey and Rep. Jamaal Bowman introduced the Heating and Cooling Relief Act, with the specific purpose of ending energy poverty in this country. The bill would significantly increase funding for the government's Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). LIHEAP, which I represent, helps low- and moderate-income families pay their home energy bills. Currently, LIHEAP can only reach between about 16% and 18% of eligible families due to underfunding.Other approaches have helped families pay their energy bills, but they have either stalled or have been severely underfunded. The enhanced child tax credit provides monthly payments to families to help them raise their children, but it expired at the end of 2021. The program had been extremely successful. In fact, an analysis of Census Bureau data last year by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that 91% of families with incomes of less than $35,000 used their funds for basic expenses, including utility bills. A proposal in the Build Back Better bill would extend the credit for another year, but that bill has been stalled in the Senate. Outstanding energy bill debts remain at very high levels. For example, in California, families are overdue on about $1.9 billion in utilities bills. In New York, it's $1.3 billion, in Massachusetts it's $630 million and in Georgia it's $79 million. Many of the families will have to enter into potentially onerous repayment plans, and those who cannot repay their utility debts will be faced with power shutoffs. The Markey/Bowman bill would directly address the utility bill payment crises by significantly increasing the authorized annual spending level for LIHEAP from the current appropriation level of about $3.8 billion to $40 billion. It would also ensure that no eligible family of four would pay more than 3% of their income on home energy (low-income families typically spend about 8.6% of their household income on home energy, compared to just 3% for higher-income households). Read MoreTaxing extreme wealth could lift 2.3 billion people out of povertyIt would also expand the program to assist moderate-income families by raising the income eligibility ceiling from 150% of poverty level (or 60% of state median income) to 250% of poverty level (or 80% of state median income).  What's more, the bill would provide emergency funds to help these families pay higher energy bills due to increased air-conditioning needs during periods of extreme heat. The need for this type of assistance is likely to increase, given that, according to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, heat waves are five times more likely to occur with the current state of climate change.The bill would also allow states to use their grants to weatherize about one million low- and moderate-income units each year. In order to meet national climate goals, this would require, where possible, that program funds be used to purchase appliances and heating and cooling systems that would run on electricity produced from renewable energy sources.  Passing the Markey/Bowman bill will be a major step in taking this difficult burden off the backs of millions of low- and moderate-income families. Congress should pass this bill and find the funds to pay for it. It's long overdue."

Our workforce is the lifeblood of the US federal government. Without individuals committed to public service, taxpayers, vulnerable populations and small businesses would not have access to critical resources and services. If the federal government fails to attract and hire the best and the brightest into service, the nation and the people it serves suffer.  Unfortunately, we're already starting to see this play out. Today, federal agencies are failing to promote and leverage internship and fellowship programs to attract early-career talent. A recent report found that there are nearly six and a half times more federal employees who are older than 50 than under 30. The recently released Biden-Harris Management Agenda Vision also highlighted this increasing age gap in the workforce. In 2008, federal employees age 60 and older comprised about 10% of the workforce. Today, they comprise 14%. Civil service experts foresee a catastrophic retirement tsunami, gutting the federal government. Yet, we currently have no plan to replace those with years of expertise who are poised to leave federal service.As chairman of the House Subcommittee on Government Operations, I have spent three years examining this looming crisis. So last month, I introduced the NextGen Feds Act. Most importantly, the bill seeks to provide a pathway to full-time federal service to interns who successfully complete at least one year of federal internship service. Those interns who meet certain criteria would gain advantage in the hiring process, rewarding acumen and proven talent.Read MoreThis is a much-needed proposal to prevent a workforce breakdown. Despite years of effort, strategic human capital management of the federal workforce remains on the Government Accountability Office's high risk list — the federal watchdog's compilation of federal programs and operations most vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse or mismanagement, or generally in dire need of transformation. And myriad additional high risk threats stem from the federal government's inability to find, hire and train individuals to fill critical gaps in the federal workforce. These skill gaps involve the financial management of the Department of Defense's weapon systems, the enforcement of our federal tax laws, the cybersecurity of sensitive information, the effective vetting of our national security workforce, and the provision of accessible and quality health care to our veterans — just to name a few.  So why has the federal government struggled to attract young people? Some say it's the comparatively low pay for in-demand skills in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Pew Research Center found that Baby Boomers are simply staying in their jobs longer than previous generations, leaving fewer job openings for younger workers. Still, others point to the laborious and opaque hiring processes of the federal government as a barrier to early-career entry. In a poll published in 2019, the federal government's reputation ranked last in comparison to 100 top companies. That is a quite a departure from John F. Kennedy's call to public service.But it isn't just the public sector that is facing a Great Resignation. The pandemic has caused workers across the board to re-evaluate what they look for in an employment package, from telework flexibility, compensation, student loan repayment options and parental leave.This cocktail of hurdles to hiring early career individuals inhibits the federal government's ability to compete for talent with private sector competitors. But we cannot expect federal agencies to fix this problem by themselves — Congress has a pivotal role to play. Surging food prices are hurting those who can least afford it. This is what needs to happenRight now, it is unclear how many federal interns and federal internship programs exist. No federal agency is tasked with collecting such information — or ensuring that interns are treated appropriately and supported throughout their service. The best-known internship program, Pathways, which has interns in agencies across the federal government, had more than 60,000 paid interns in 2010, but by 2020 participation had tanked to just 4,000.While the federal government struggles to count how many interns it has, one private company that competes with the government for talent recently told me that they offer jobs to approximately 96% of their interns. And nearly every offer is accepted. Simply put, individuals graduating from top schools are not attracted to enter federal service, and those who intern for the federal government aren't guaranteed a pathway to full-time work. The NextGen Feds Act will change that. It would bring uniformity and best practices, like mentorships and exit interviews, to federal internships across the government. These measures can improve an intern's experience and help agencies get better at engaging early-career talent. Upon enactment, the legislation would establish a federal internship and fellowship center within the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and would require OPM to design and manage an online internship platform for agencies and those seeking internships. The legislation seeks to foster diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility by requiring federal agencies to pay all interns.  Our nation is at an inflection point, and the federal government must meet the moment. Young people seek jobs with meaning and flexibility. Federal agencies excel at offering occupations vested in passion and purpose. Government must work to shift the Great Resignation into a bold recruitment and retention effort. As we ring in a new year, we must continue our work to foster a more vibrant, diverse employee population — and find and grow the talent that will innovate us through whatever the future has in store."

Almost two years after the pandemic upended labor markets, job openings are plentiful in many advanced economies, yet workers have not fully returned.The broader trend of plentiful jobs and not enough workers can have major implications for growth, inequality and inflation.This gap, in which the employment rate is below its pre-Covid level, is playing out in the United States and the United Kingdom. Despite tight labor markets, as reflected in high vacancy-to-unemployment ratios and job quits, the employment recovery remains incomplete and below pre-pandemic levels in both countries. Now with a possible cooling effect on labor markets caused by the Omicron wave, this trend could be longer than expected.New IMF staff research uses granular data on employment and vacancies in the US and the UK to assess four commonly held explanations:The effect of generous income support on willingness to seek and take up jobsA mismatch between the types of jobs that are available and the willingness of people to fill themMothers of young children exiting the work force amid continued disruptions to school and childcareOlder workers withdrawing from the labor forceRead MoreWe found that lower participation among older workers not returning to work is the common thread, and matters most. Mismatch plays a secondary role. The fall in female participation is unique to the US, but also quantitatively important.If the broader trend continues, it can have major implications for growth, inequality and inflation. A continued sluggish employment recovery could constrain economic growth while fueling wage increases. While higher wages would be good news for workers, they could further fuel inflation.Generosity of income support programsThe first possible explanation is that income support programs during the pandemic allowed workers to be picky, slowing job applications, acceptances and, ultimately, the employment recovery.However, preliminary evidence reviewed in our paper, including from the recent phasing out of the US federal unemployment insurance supplement, suggests the early removal of Covid-related unemployment benefits had only a modest and temporary effect on getting people back to work.MismatchA second explanation is an increase in the mismatch between the industries and occupations in which the jobless are searching and those with abundant vacancies. Jobs that require in-person interactions, such as in restaurants, hotels and entertainment, have been hit exceptionally hard, while ""teleworkable"" jobs fared substantially better. Others, like delivery services, even boomed. Could it be that workers who lost jobs in hard-hit industries and occupations struggled to transition into new opportunities, leading to mismatch?LinkedIn economist: 3 ways the pandemic has dramatically changed the labor marketThe short answer is yes, but this is just one part of the story. We find that the employment loss due to mismatch during the crisis has been modest and, to our surprise, smaller than during the Global Financial Crisis. We estimate that, as of early last fall, mismatch explains only about 18% and 11% of the outstanding employment gap versus pre-Covid levels in the US and the UK, respectively.The She-cessionA third explanation seems more potent, at least in the US. The prolonged school closures and scarcity of childcare services put an extra burden on mothers of young children, pushing many to leave the labor force — the so-called ""She-cession.""We estimate that the excess employment contraction for mothers of children younger than 5 years old compared with other women accounted for around 16% of the total US employment gap with respect to pre-Covid levels as of October 2021. That was down from 23% in early September, thanks partly to the return to in-person schooling later that month. Meanwhile, there was no such She-cession in the UK, where employment fell less for females than for males. A potential explanation is that in the UK nurseries remained opened throughout the pandemic, easing the tradeoff between work and childcare for mothers of young children.Withdrawal of older workersThe final and potentially largest contributor to a lag in employment recovery is an exodus of older workers from the labor force in both countries. For some, this may reflect health concerns related to the pandemic. Others may have reconsidered their need to work as housing and financial asset prices grew substantially.As of September, the rise in inactivity among workers age 55 and up accounted for around 35% of the outstanding employment gap versus pre-pandemic levels in both economies. It's unclear how many of those who retired or quit may eventually return to the labor force.Beware of scarringTaken together, mismatch, the She-cession and older workers' withdrawal from the labor force may account for roughly 70% of the US employment gap compared with pre-Covid levels. In the UK, there has been no She-cession, but about 10% of the employment gap can be attributed to mismatch and 35% to older workers' withdrawal from labor force.Omicron is crushing small businesses like ours. But there are solutionsFurther, the outflow of foreign workers after Brexit — accelerated by the pandemic — entailed a progressive fall in the number of those job seekers willing and able to fill open vacancies. Our analysis leaves a potential, albeit mostly residual, role for other factors such as the effect of elevated unemployment benefits and other pandemic-related income support.If a larger number of older workers permanently retire and a lack of affordable childcare and pre-school opportunities continue to keep some women with young children at home, the pandemic could leave persistent employment scars, notably in the US.Whether the reason for not returning to work is early retirement or lack of childcare, one common thread exists: US and UK vacancies are highest among low-skill occupations and employment in these jobs remains below pre-2020 levels. The rise in voluntary quits — the so-called ""great resignation"" — are also greatest for low-skilled jobs. While it remains to be seen how widespread and persistent this phenomenon will be, these facts hint at a possible change in worker preferences triggered by the pandemic.To minimize the risk of scarring to employment, addressing the pandemic remains key, so workers are fully able to return to the labor market. So are well-designed training programs to reduce risks of mismatch, and — particularly in the US — expanded childcare and preschool opportunities."

The nation's sizzling housing market is a double-edged sword: millions of existing homeowners have gotten a boost as they watch their equity grow, but millions more would-be homeowners are struggling to get their foot in the door — especially buyers of color. As of January of this year, the typical US home has gained more than $50,000 in value from the year prior — a jump of almost 20% — as millions of buyers bid against each other in a market defined by historic low inventory. The Sun Belt, which has been a relatively affordable alternative to the ultra-expensive coastal markets, was especially hot, with home values in major markets gaining as much as 45%.It increasingly looks like this year will be more of the same. Home value growth has already reaccelerated well ahead of the typical spring shopping season, and we just saw the largest inventory drop in at least three years. Zillow's economic research team predicts home values will gain another nearly 20% by year's end.While that's good news for homeowners watching their equity grow, millions of Americans who are trying to buy a home for the first time are watching that dream slip further away. That's especially true for Black Americans, who were hard hit by pandemic-related job losses. The Black homeownership rate is lower today than it was a decade ago. A big part of the problem is that Black Americans typically have lower incomes and less wealth, making it more difficult to save for a down payment. And they are more likely to have no credit history and be denied a mortgage.The typical Black household has less than a quarter of the wealth of a typical White household — a $3 trillion gap that has widened in the past decade. Housing disparities — brought by generations of systemic inequality, such as redlining and disparate credit access — account for nearly 40% of that gap. Black-owned homes are worth about 18% less than White-owned homes.Read MoreCombined, all these factors mean Black families are likely to fall further behind despite unprecedented growth in the real estate market. And because homeownership is a major driver of generational wealth in America, their children and grandchildren will also potentially fall further behind. But there are steps we can take to prevent the wealth gap from growing even further:Build, build, buildIt's going to take adding inventory of all types to significantly slow price growth and unlock homeownership for more Americans.More than 60% of homes in the United States are single-family detached houses, with many of those neighborhoods created and kept that way largely through decades-old zoning restrictions. They also skew more White and tend to be more expensive than the broader metro area they're in.Easing zoning rules to allow modest densification in single-family neighborhoods would add millions of homes to our choked housing supply. And it's something a majority of homeowners — and two-thirds of Black homeowners — agree should be allowed. Zillow research has shown that allowing an additional unit on just 10% of single-family lots can yield more than 3 million new homes across just 17 metro areas. That's especially important for households of color, which are more likely to live in higher-density housing, including condos and townhomes. Reform the credit systemPeople with structural access to credit and strong credit histories are more likely to own a home. Black Americans are more likely than Whites to have no credit history, and those with marginal, poor or non-existing credit will struggle to get a loan and will pay more for it. Majority Black, indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) communities also have less access to traditional financial services and are closer to predatory services, such as payday lenders and pawn shops. We must create a credit reporting system that routinely takes into account things like rental history and utility bill payments (and that doesn't weigh so heavily on credit cards, auto loans and mortgages), and work to provide equitable financial services to underserved communities. Fannie Mae recently started allowing rental payment history to be taken into account to give some buyers a better chance to qualify. Help with down paymentsAffording a down payment is an increasingly difficult barrier to homeownership. First-time buyers should expect to spend a year longer saving for a down payment than they would have needed to just five years ago. There is help — in fact, more than 2,000 counties have 10 or more programs available that provide grants or loans to help with down payments and closing costs. But buyers generally aren't aware of the help that's available, and there needs to be more.The economy is recovering fast. But we need to ensure it works for everyoneIn addition, first-time buyer savings accounts give people a tax-free way to save for a down payment and closing costs, similar to programs allowing tax-free college savings. Such accounts are available now in some states, but the federal government should take the lead in providing for them everywhere.Bias training and safeguardsEveryone should be able to shop for and find a home free from bias, discrimination and racism. Anyone responsible for real estate license renewal requirements should mandate implicit bias training. That way, industry professionals have the tools they need to ensure they aren't creating barriers for people to access certain communities or opportunities. Similarly, more states should require fair lending training that addresses the effect of bias, and lenders should review and update their training to ensure it's addressed. The industry should also embrace remote desktop appraisals, which rely on visual technology, such as 3D-tours and digital floorplans, rather than an in-person visit to the property. That can mitigate bias in the appraisal process so existing BIPOC homeowners can tap into their equity more equitably, and be protected against discriminatory practices.Nobody alive today will see America reach racial housing equality. We will need a renewed investment in these and other solutions to keep the gap from widening during this overheated market and set us on the right path to ensure housing market growth is equitable, fair and beneficial."

She is author of ""Now I Know Who My Comrades Are: Voices From the Internet Underground."" She owns some cryptocurrency. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.




China's digital yuan is poised to make its debut on the global stage this week, with foreign athletes and others at the Beijing Olympics able to use it for the first time. People can access digital yuan via an app on their smartphone, for example, but it's different from other payment apps in that it is a digital version of the renminbi, issued by the People's Bank of China. The digital yuan has already been piloted in various Chinese cities and was used in more than $8 billion worth of transactions in the second half of 2021. China's efforts have also spurred other countries to ponder digital currencies of their own. Nearly 90 countries, accounting for more than 90% of global GDP, are actively exploring a central bank digital currency (CBDC), according to the Atlantic Council.  Some would argue that CBDCs will cancel out the need for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. After all, how many different digital currencies do we really need? But in fact, the opposite is true. The rise of CBDCs highlights the importance of decentralized cryptocurrencies that are relatively private and not controlled by any government. While China's digital currency is an impressive undertaking that could offer many benefits, such as ease and efficiency of payments, privacy is not one of them. If anything, the digital yuan will give the government greater visibility into the financial transactions of its citizens. You may not have to provide an ID to make small payments, Yaya Fanusie, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said in an interview. But ""the government is going to be able to trace all transactions, generally, whether they are anonymized or not."" Read MoreCentral bank digital currencies are coming. The US must be preparedChina already has a very sophisticated mobile payments system, led by WeChat Pay and Alipay. Companies already collect plenty of private financial data, but the digital yuan will make that data even more accessible to the government. Fanusie said the Chinese government can already go to the payment companies and get the data, but with the digital yuan, they won't need to take that extra step because they will already have direct access to that data. With the digital yuan, he said, ""they barely have to lift a finger. The data comes to them."" CBDCs are not only trackable, they may also be programmable. After a natural disaster, for example, a government could send citizens digital money that could be spent on food and medicine, but not alcohol. This means that governments will have a greater ability to decide who has access to digital money. In China's case, Fanusie said, ""it's going to be easy for the central bank to turn off any wallets they want to turn off, because of political issues or crime fighting or whatever."" It is too early to know exactly how central bank digital currencies will play out in practice, but concerns are so great that Congressman Tom Emmer cited privacy issues in legislation he introduced that would prohibit the US Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC directly to individuals.Cryptocurrencies offer a fundamentally different approach. Bitcoin, the world's leading cryptocurrency, was introduced after the 2008 financial crisis as a form of money that was meant to be independent of government or bank control. Bitcoin transactions are stored on a decentralized ledger known as a blockchain.One of the main advantages of bitcoin is that no government can stop you from sending or receiving it, and no government can shut down the network. Bitcoin is also a relatively private form of money, in the sense that all you need to send and receive bitcoin is an address that consists of a string of numbers and letters. Some are drawn to cryptocurrencies simply because they believe that even perfectly legal transactions should enjoy basic privacy protections.China wants to weaponize its currency. A digital version could helpSome crypto purists will argue that even bitcoin is not private enough, as all bitcoin transactions are recorded on a publicly viewable blockchain. Still, attaching a bitcoin address to a real person's identity takes work: Governments or spy agencies would have to devote a good deal of time, skill and effort to the task of analyzing blockchain data. CBDCs like China's, by contrast, are designed to be traceable by the government. Developers are currently working to increase bitcoin's privacy protections. But there are other digital currencies, for example zcash and monero, that promote privacy protection as a key feature. Zcash, for example, uses a cryptographic tool known as zero-knowledge proofs, which is a way to verify a set of data without revealing that data. New cryptocurrencies are constantly appearing, and we are likely to see even more innovation when it comes to privacy. China's digital yuan may eventually become the country's main form of payment. ""Whether I embrace the digital Renminbi or not is not up to me to decide,"" Victor Gao, chair professor at China's Soochow University, said in an interview. ""If I stay in China, if I remain a global citizen, I think this wave will hit me sooner or later. I cannot fight against it, I can't resist it without being buried by it.""Other countries, including the United States, may not be able to resist the temptation to roll out a CBDC of their own. But government-backed digital currencies should not reign supreme. Other cryptocurrencies are needed to preserve an independent and relatively private form of digital money in a world where transactions are becoming easier for governments to track and control."

He has invested in Advanced Earthen Construction Technologies. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. 




The Build Back Better bill, if it ever comes to pass, now seems unlikely to include any major climate change provisions. But we can still reduce our own carbon emissions, starting with our own homes. About 20% of greenhouse gases in the US come from homes. And the homes of the wealthiest Americans, who can most easily afford climate-saving modernizations, emit about 25% more greenhouse gases per capita than those of lower-income residents. These are problems we can solve, as homeowners, with new technology, and through government incentives. Switch from a gas-powered furnace to an electric heat pumpWhen we think about our home's carbon footprint, most of us think of solar panels, but switching to electricity from fossil fuels for heating our home's air and water may be even more important. More than half of the energy homes use is for heating and air conditioning, and nearly two-thirds of US homes rely on fossil fuels for heat.Switching from natural gas to electricity for heating a home has a dramatic impact on its carbon output. In a place like Sacramento, for instance, that switch would reduce its emissions by 45% today. And the benefits would only increase over time. Unlike the furnace burning gas in your basement, the power plants generating electricity for a heat pump will get more efficient, getting more power from the sun and other sources of renewable energy. So that Sacramento home would, if electrified, emit 82% less greenhouse gases by 2050. The home would also have lower utility bills.Read MoreStop thinking of natural gas as cleanerThe reason most people haven't already made this transition is because we don't even think of our homes as being heated by fossil fuels. The energy industry has promoted natural gas as ""a cleaner-burning"" fuel for heating your air and water and for powering your stove, oven and dryer. It's true that burning natural gas produces about half the amount of carbon dioxide that coal does, for the same amount of energy. But producing and transporting natural gas to your home emits methane, which can be 86 times more potent at warming the planet than carbon dioxide. This is only one reason why, in the US, natural gas contributes just as much to climate change as coal. End permits for buildings heated by fossil fuelsChanging how we heat every home in America is a massive undertaking, but the good news is we've done it before. Coal or wood heated about 77% of US homes in 1940 and about 16% by 1960. This cycle is beginning anew now: More than 50 cities in California, and most recently New York City, have stopped or plan to stop granting permits for buildings that use natural gas or other fossil fuels rather than electricity. But other states are moving in the opposite direction. By 2021, 20 US states had quietly prepared ""preemption laws,"" exempting natural gas utilities from city regulations. That means that, absent an expensive retrofit, many buildings will likely be powered by gas for decades. Give homeowners electrification incentivesSuch preemption laws are just one example of why we need federal action, but progress there has been mixed. The Build Back Better plan, which would have provided billions of dollars in subsidies largely for home electrification and retrofits, is unlikely to continue in its current form. The evidence that its incentives would've worked is overwhelming. The use of heat pumps has boomed where governments have offset part of the costs.  Invest in technology But government incentives aren't the only way to reduce our homes' impact on the climate. As the technology improves for heat pumps, induction ranges and other appliances to make the home more efficient, people will adopt these technologies just to save money, and to be more comfortable.Buyers, get ready for another crazy housing market next yearSolar panels are the obvious example of how technology can change the economics of mass adoption. From 2009 to 2019, the cost of generating solar power declined 89%, from $359 per megawatt-hour to $40. After accounting for plant-building and operating costs, solar panels were once three times more expensive than fossil fuels, but now are less than half the cost of fossil fuels.This sea-change in efficiency is why the majority of people who install solar panels now save money from day one. There is usually no down-payment required for a solar panel loan, and the typical utility bill savings can exceed the monthly loan payment even in the first year. It should thus come as no surprise that it took the US 40 years to get a million solar panel installations, and only three years to get the next million. Use more eco-friendly materials and construction methodsThe way we build and furnish homes is changing, too. Homes are being built in factories by companies like Plant Prefab and Veev, lowering the environmental impact of their construction and operation while improving building time, cost and the quality of construction. Other companies, like Advanced Earthen Construction Technologies, are now manufacturing homes out of earthen blocks, avoiding the use of lumber and concrete, both of which contribute to global warming. Earthen-block homes are naturally insulated against extreme temperatures, and are resistant to the wildfires that are becoming more common in the West.As home construction, power generation, and heating and cooling technologies change, we just have to make sure our thinking changes, too. Home ownership now comes with new responsibilities, and new opportunities to leave the world better than we found it. This involves learning about a new kind of economics, not only to own a home, but to run it. Our goal can be not just to benefit our own family, but all of us."

I confess to being old enough to have watched the premiere of ""Saturday Night Live"" in 1975. It was, from the start, exciting, ground-breaking television.Since then, I have seen the majority of episodes. Not all of them, of course, because like most ""SNL"" viewers, I have found some periods in its mostly spectacular history more appealing (as in, funnier) than others.I have never held the fallow periods against the show, because the show's creative maestro, Lorne Michaels, somehow always manages to find the way back to relevance and inspired comedy. (You're not going to stay on the air for nearly 50 years if you can't.)So I feel reasonably well-equipped to say: The current season, which has reached its holiday hiatus point, can be legitimately ranked with past examples (Season 26 in 2000 when Tina Fey and Jimmy Fallon teamed up on Weekend Update; Season 21 in 1995 when Will Ferrell and others joined the cast) as a genuine comeback story.I'm not alone. Reviews for this season have been substantially positive. A typical comment, this one from Kelly Lawler at USA Today: ""'SNL' this season so far has been unexpectedly hilarious, delightful and thrilling."" Read MoreThat's not an appraisal ""SNL"" was routinely receiving in recent years, when criticism was lobbed at the show for being creatively stalled. So what changed?The most obvious answer: we are not in the middle of a presidential race. ""SNL"" has always thrived on political satire; parodies of debates and other campaign moments have generated some of its most memorable sketches and catchphrases: ""Strategery"" from Will Ferrell as George Bush in 2000; ""I can see Russia from my house!"" from Tina Fey as Sarah Palin in 2008; ""Who am I? Why am I here?"" from Phil Hartman as Admiral James Stockdale in 1992. And when Donald Trump emerged as candidate and then president, the show experienced a jolt of positive attention from Alec Baldwin's extremely broad Trump impression.Bowen Yang as the Iceberg that sank the Titanic, left, and anchor Colin Jost during Weekend Update on ""Saturday Night Live"" in New York on April 10, 2021. But as has happened with ""SNL"" in the past, expectations that the show must jump on every egregious event coming out of Washington sometimes winds up forcing creative decisions. In the case of Trump, there were a slew of those events, many so closely resembling the theater of the absurd they were almost impossible to parody (drinking bleach; redrawing weather maps; Mexico paying for the wall).In the last few years of Trump-centric news, ""SNL"" seemed to exhaust itself in search of a fresh comic take, something other than how ridiculous or menacing Trump could be.It didn't help that the entire world of late-night was equally suffused in Trump-preposterousness, because of comedy imperatives and the conviction that his actions had to be mocked.This season has brought the first sustained respite from Trump in seven years. The character has appeared, but sparingly, and the impression, performed by new cast member James Austin Johnson, is more character than caricature. Johnson is capturing the Trump voice and mannerisms as they really are, not as a cartoonish performance. (Baldwin, to be fair, was very funny in many sketches in the early Trump years.)Notably, the show has also done little of substance with Joe Biden, though Johnson also has a skillful take on him. Jim Carrey was an exceptional bit of star-casting, but he didn't knock critics out.Perhaps because of the huge focus on politics, or because the cast has not been the most memorable, Michaels did a lot of that stunt-casting in recent years, especially in bringing back cast favorites. But the best seasons of ""SNL"" have been all about the regular cast.Late-night television may never be the sameAnd that's what has been happening this year. Some relatively newer cast members are moving to the forefront. Bowen Yang is proving extremely versatile; and Pete Davidson, who earlier leaned heavily on his stand-up skills, has made a mark with well-formed sketch characters (his Andrew Cuomo is dead-on great) and in music videos. (The ""Walking in Staten"" parody of ""Walking in Memphis"" is a highlight of this season.)But there have been other highlights, some generated by hosts, many of whom excelled this season. Maybe most surprising was Kim Kardashian, who defied expectations by shining in her appearance. (One line from her monologue: ""I'm just so much more than that reference photo my sisters showed their plastic surgeons."") Kieran Culkin and Simu Liu were also very busy in their stints, a sign the writers saw real comedy chops. So was Billie Eilish, who had a highlight commercial parody on top of two eye-popping music performances.Still, by almost universal agreement, the standout performance of the season was turned in by long-time cast member Cecily Strong, with an impassioned Weekend Update segment as Goober the clown, a searingly funny commentary about abortion rights.Weekend Update also seems refreshed. After some seasons where the jokes felt flat, they have been sharp and more frequently laugh-out-loud: ""An 83-year-old man has become the oldest person ever to hike the Appalachian Trail. The man dedicated the walk to his wife . . . who died a few miles back."" Overall it's enough to conclude, with the heavy lift of a presidential election year behind it, something really interesting is happening at ""SNL"" again. To put a spin on Chevy Chase's now-famous words from his early days on the show: Unlike Generalissimo Francisco Franco, ""SNL"" is still alive!"

'Tis the season; but there aren't many reasons to be jolly.The pandemic is back, not that it ever really left. Headlines are again dominated by explosively rising case numbers, which means equally rising levels of depression and panic. Covid is a news story so inescapable it swallows up the attention of the nation.And yet, in lists of the biggest news stories of 2021 that media organizations are composing, while Covid is huge, the ongoing challenge to American democracy is a constant. The headlines began in January with the first serious attempted coup in US history and have been running ever since, highlighted by the unceasing machinations by supporters of Donald Trump to either restore him to office or find some extra-legal way to eliminate the possibility he could ever lose if he ran again. Indeed, as much as the Covid crisis has affected our nation, I have no hesitation in arguing that the story of our imperiled democracy is the biggest story of the year — a story unlike any we have seen before in the United States. The Capitol insurrection — and the egregious attempts by one party first to blow up the peaceful transfer of power, the bedrock of our democracy, and then to make several attempts to ensure no election would ever again deny them power — has sweeping implications for the future. I certainly don't believe I have seen any other news story in my own lifetime, which goes back to the 1950s, that has shaken the nation to its foundations as this one has. Read MoreThe country has been buffeted by tragic and frightening stories throughout the decades I have followed the news, starting, in my own experience, with the John F. Kennedy assassination. The shooting of JFK certainly seemed like a thunderbolt hurled at the heart of our government — with all kinds of disorienting details, including the accused assassin being murdered live on television, then the immediate and persistent conspiracy theories that ran rampant. A terrible time for sure.Next: the escalation of the Vietnam War, which ran parallel to the struggle of the Civil Rights movement and made the '60s the most divisive time in my early life.The '70s brought Watergate, which was supposed to be the biggest political scandal of our history.On through the many tragic and disturbing mass shootings, especially the horrific killings of schoolchildren. Then the terrifying morning of 9/11, an event that did unite the nation — in overpowering grief.Nothing can diminish the staggering impact of these events, and their ripple effects through the consciousness of Americans. But the moment we are at right now feels different, eerie almost, like the stillness that presages a coming storm of a magnitude we can't yet measure. The reason 'SNL' is so hilarious again? Less TrumpAll of those earlier crises brought shock, horror and terrible sadness. But the state of the nation always remained stable. Maybe only two events before my time, the Civil War and World War II, are legitimate rivals to our current crisis in terms of potential destructive impact. In both those earlier cases, our democracy also came under mortal threat, once from internal forces, once external. Both encompassed authoritarianism, violent threats to opponents, popular appeal based on rage and grievances, a cult following and very big lies. And, in both those past crises, our democracy still survived.Bloodshed on the scale seen during those two wars is unlikely now; but democracy's survival is no sure bet. Mainly that's because the truth of the threat is being either abused or obscured. For the first time, a group trying to unravel democracy has its own media megaphone to blast out propagandistic disinformation about the 2020 election, falsely claiming that it was stolen, despite an utter lack of evidence.Lies about the election have been thoroughly discredited already, in courts and endless ""audits."" But pro-Trump Republicans continue to believe the fabrications, and worse, use them to install biased election officials and to enact laws that pave the way for them to overturn vote totals they don't like — all accompanied by unceasing efforts to suppress or deny the vote to people who oppose them.That utterly unjustified and nefarious activity is the fuel stoking the drive to see the American experiment in a government of the people, for the people and by the people perish from the earth. This isn't a case of over-the-top partisan politics gone a bit too far, where one side pushes this way and the other side pushes back. It's a slowly unfolding horror movie; and yes, unless something changes the scary ending, it will certainly be the biggest news story of my lifetime."

Ah, Christmas movies: the snow, the decorations, the families reuniting, the elves, Santa, the reindeer, the couples from the covers of romance novels falling in love against all odds.Wait. What?If you haven't noticed how the 10 most common tropes of Christmas movies have changed in recent years, you have clearly not been tuning in to the Hallmark Channel, Lifetime or even Netflix during the month of December. Because on those channels, what Christmas is about — mainly — is the many ways lovelorn couples can come together under the mistletoe and eventually discover that love is the greatest present of all!This trend has been expanding every year, obviously because there is an audience that loves nothing more at this time of year than settling down under a cozy blanket to see how many ways moviemakers can contrive to make boy-meets-girl (or, this year, boy-meets-boy and girl-meets-girl) work in the context of a holiday setting.Take one of the many new movies this holiday season: ""A Picture Perfect Holiday"" (Lifetime). It involves a young woman photographer who, through a booking mishap, is forced to share her guest chalet (heavily decorated with lights and tinsel) with a guy who is also a photographer and arrives on the scene shirtless, dressed only in a towel.Read MoreBrooke Shields manages to up the location ante by sharing a castle with a Scottish Duke, played by Cary Elwes, speaking in a burr as deep as a dish of haggis. The movie is called ""A Castle for Christmas,"" so nobody misses the point. (The castle is amply decorated, of course.)For all the familiarity, it's a more interesting year for the Christmas romance genre, because beyond the usual single gals who've been unlucky in love until this special season where the dreamy guys drop into their lives like Santa sliding down the chimney, there is a gay hero in one film (Netflix's ""Single All the Way"") who finally realizes his best friend is the love of his life, and a gay woman in another (Lifetime's ""Under the Christmas Tree"") who is smitten by a cute gal after a Christmas tree dispute. Of course, Christmas movies have always served up huge dollops of fantasy, so it's not surprising that a lot of folks enjoy this escape into fictional romance. (""The Bachelor"" has been proving that for 26 iterations.)And suspending disbelief is kind of at the root of secular Christmas, what with flying sleighs and bottomless bags of goodies. Current movies are just following the pattern, and they don't mind treading all over the familiar territory blazed by earlier Christmas favorites, like ""It's a Wonderful Life."" So who is to be so cynical as to see gooey instead of goodies in tales like ""An Ice Wine Christmas"" (Lifetime), where two wine specialists meet at a wine festival on a cold wintry day? Will they hook up? (Do reindeer really know how to fly?)And it would only be churlish to wonder why, in virtually all these films, there is snow everywhere and people shivering but you never, ever see anyone's breath — certainly not before lips meet in the final kiss. To be brutally pedantic about it, Christmas movies are not shot in December, but usually in the summer. And in California. So nobody is cold, the snow is fake, and the extravagant visuals — trees, lights, gingerbread houses — are thanks to the skill of set decorators.But again: suspension of disbelief.That clearly comes into play not just in the romantic fables of the season. Like every other aspect of entertainment, hits tend to inspire sequels, no matter how contrived they have to be to continue the original story. It's not a literal sequel, but one movie, ""Blending Christmas"" (Lifetime), about a couple worrying about blending two families after they marry, features not one but four of the cast members of ""The Brady Bunch.""'The Sopranos' movie was never going to be as good as the TV showVanessa Hudgens is back for a third turn in a Netflix franchise called ""The Princess Switch,"" (a riff on ""The Prince and the Pauper""); only this time she plays three parts, not just two.But nothing tops Disney's ""Home Sweet Home Alone,"" which looks from its trailer like a tracing of the original ""Home Alone"" movie: kid left at home; oblivious parents off on vacation holiday; two thieves trying to rob something; all kinds of comically violent traps laid by the kid — and it all happens at Christmas! What's most remarkable is that this is the sixth ""Home Alone"" movie. Have parents learned nothing about counting up their kids in the past 30 years?The horde of ""Home Alone"" sequels may be a revelation in the contemporary crop of Christmas-themed movies. But that people want more romance in their lives? No surprise there.Nor is the absence of one of the oldest and formerly most cherished principles of Christmas, one that inspired a raft of movie plotlines in Hollywood's past. ""Good will"" toward men and women and people in general. Remember that?It isn't much in evidence these days, not even in the fantasies of Christmas movies."

The value of a college education has come under scrutiny in recent years. With average student debt in the US rising to more than $37,000 in recent estimates, more students are wondering if it is a choice they can afford. And as more affordable online programs become increasingly available, others question whether the ""traditional"" college experience is relevant anymore.  As someone who did not attend college, but who served for many years as a trustee on the board of the largest private university in my home state of Minnesota, I myself have pressed our leaders in higher education to address rising costs and the burden of student debt so that every student can reap the rewards and returns of a traditional college education. But it is not just the cost of education that determines if a student will generate a positive return on the experience. It is also, obviously, what they learn and how they learn it.One way to make college more impactful for all students is to engage them in learning the entrepreneurial skillset. Whether as an entrepreneurship major or minor, or in liberal arts courses that explore the entrepreneurial mindset and process, or through venture competitions, startup incubators or design thinking workshops — teaching students to think and act as entrepreneurs does remarkable things. It motivates and energizes students, it builds their critical and creative thinking capabilities, it focuses them on the ways they can make an impact in the world, and it prepares them to enter the workforce with passion, purpose and confidence. Regardless of whether they start a business or not, students with entrepreneurial training are better equipped to identify and craft opportunities for themselves and their employers, to bring innovative thinking to the problems they face and to mobilize the resources they need to implement new and better solutions.And while some may think that entrepreneurs are born, I disagree. As is true in any discipline or craft, someone with significant raw entrepreneurial talent still needs formal education and training. Formal education isn't just about learning facts and formulas, although being exposed to a broader range of ideas and knowledge is, of course, invaluable in and of itself. The best education is one that teaches people how to think. And an entrepreneurial education demands just that — it means you must take what you are learning and color it with your own unique perspective and creative insight. Unconventional, out-of-the-box thinking requires confidence and boldness, which are muscles worked in a formal educational setting. And students inspire and push each other as much as faculty, and sometimes more. I would also argue that calculated risk-taking — something essential for innovation, entrepreneurship or creativity in any field — is worth teaching in a proper setting. The best entrepreneurs aren't those who necessarily hit a home run on their first attempt; they keep trying, and they learn from their failures. Being in that setting, with expert guidance from faculty and collaboration with classmates, offers security, as well as permission to fail and the lessons around how to fail smart. Without that kind of lived experience in the classroom, many would-be entrepreneurs never find the confidence to take the risks that could make their aspirations real. Read MoreA formal education can be especially helpful for potential entrepreneurs coming from underrepresented or marginalized backgrounds. Small business ownership is one of the best ways to build intergenerational wealth, and we can't afford for talented and driven young people to miss out on this opportunity. How we can solve the nation's affordable housing crisisStill, the rising cost of education remains a critical issue that needs to be addressed if we wish to see these students excel. Universities must continue to cut costs, and those of us with the resources to do so must step up to support scholarships, mentorships and internships to help all students access and make the most of their experience. Let's not give up on college. The truth is it remains a crucial driver of success. But we must empower our students with the skills to be innovators, creators and entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship education empowers students to think creatively, to seek opportunities and solve problems, to empathize with others, to take risks, to accept failure as part of the growth process, and to help take a passion or idea and turn it into a viable business. Learning to think and act like an entrepreneur emboldens students to take charge of their own destinies, and in doing so, it powers the American Dream. My success story is the kind of entrepreneurship story that people like to glamorize, but the reason those stories are popular is because they're so unlikely. What we need right now aren't idealized stories of success, but a reliable pathway for all bright young minds with the right ideas to make the most of their opportunities, and entrepreneurial education provides just that."

But on the morning of July 13, he realized something wasn't quite right as he watched jets taking off at RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk, about 70 miles northeast of London. The base is run by the US Air Force and is home to the 48th Fighter Wing, the only  US Air Force F-15 fighter wing in Europe.""This plane took off and just before it got to us ... a lot of flames and sparks started coming out the back,"" Simpson told CNN. Simpson, who previously worked for Boeing in designing aircraft traffic control procedures, listened to the radio communications between pilot Maj. Grant Thompson and the base to see if any action would be taken, but to his surprise nobody else seemed to have noticed. When he heard that the aircraft was set to refuel over the North Sea, Simpson realized the pilot was unaware of possible problems with his aircraft.

After Thompson got his wingman to confirm damage to the right motor of his F15-E Strike Eagle, the pilot safely returned to base. A week later, the pair met and Thompson thanked Simpson for his intervention, giving the aviation fan a legacy cap and the fighter wing patch that he was wearing that day, removing it from the sleeve of his jumpsuit in what the base called ""quite a significant gesture."" Simpson may not think much of his actions but personnel from 48th Fighter Wing praised his quick thinking. ""The courage that Ian displayed was next to none,"" said Capt.

A decade on, 'the hatred is still out there' but attacker's influence is seen as low","(CNN)Ten years ago, Norwegian far-right extremist Anders Behring Brevik killed 77 people, many of them teenagers, in a bomb attack and gun rampage. The July 22 attacks left Norway, a small, close-knit Nordic country, stunned and grieving.Just over a year later, Breivik was sentenced to 21 years in prison, the maximum possible term. And Norway, led by then-Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, came together in a show of unity in the wake of the deadliest violence seen there since World War II. A decade on, the anniversary will be an occasion of great sadness for many in the country of just over 5 million people. Several commemorative events are taking place Thursday in the capital, Oslo, and on Utoya Island, where the attacks took place.At a televised memorial concert, King Harald said lessons could be learned. ""Certain dates are written into our country's story as defining days. Days, which in different ways, have contributed to making us who we are today,"" he said, according to Reuters.""At the same time, we must acknowledge that we as a society have not done nearly enough to see, to help, to carry the burden together - and to counteract the dark forces,"" he added.Read MoreBut it has also prompted questions about the wider impact of Breivik's radical views on far-right extremism -- circulated in a 1,500-page ""manifesto"" shortly before the attacks -- and some soul-searching about how Norway deals with his legacy.How the far right is adopting the ISIS global modelIn a national memorial address at Oslo Cathedral just two days after the attacks, Stoltenberg called for ""more democracy, more openness, and more humanity.""Speaking with CNN's ""Amanpour"" show in an interview to mark the anniversary, Stoltenberg -- now NATO secretary-general -- repeated that message and applauded the way Norwegians had responded. But, he warned, the ""hatred is still out there.""JUST WATCHEDWe hoped the reports were exaggerated: Ten years later, Norway's PM reflects on devastating eventReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWe hoped the reports were exaggerated: Ten years later, Norway's PM reflects on devastating event 11:24Last month, the University of Oslo's Center for Research on Extremism (C-REX) published a series of analyses looking at Breivik's long-term influence.The author of one of the reports, Dr. Jacob Aasland Ravndal, told CNN it appeared more limited than media coverage would suggest. ""There was of course a lot of concern after the attacks that they would generate copycat attacks,"" he said. But ""somewhat surprisingly,"" he said, there haven't been many clear-cut cases of direct inspiration from Breivik.Floral tributes lie outside Oslo Cathedral on Thursday on the 10-year anniversary of the July 22, 2011 terrorist attacks -- commonly referred to in Norway as ""22 Juli."" One of the more apparent links is to the shooting attack in Munich, Germany on July 22, 2016, in which an 18-year-old German-Iranian man killed nine people. The rampage was carried out on the fifth anniversary of the Norway attacks and the attacker had been ""talking a lot about Breivik,"" Ravndal said. ""But he was also deeply inspired by many other figures,"" Ravndal said, some of them school-shooters.The other obvious case is that of Brenton Tarrant, the Australian far-right terrorist who live-streamed an attack in which he killed 51 Muslim worshipers at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March 2019.But although Tarrant claimed to have been inspired by Breivik, investigators found that he had started his planning some time before he read Breivik's manifesto. ""So even there, you can question how much of an impact Breivik had,"" Ravndal said. Tarrant's own manifesto is very different from Breivik's, including in its politics, he added.US Coast Guard officer Christopher Hasson, who was sentenced to 13 years in prison last year on weapons and drugs charges, consulted Breivik's manifesto for tips on amassing weapons, according to another of the papers published by C-REX. Prosecutors alleged that he was a White nationalist who was plotting an attack.Rightwing extremist Anders Behring Breivik arrives in court on April 16, 2012 for the start of his trial.The Counter Extremism Project (CEP), an NGO that combats extremist groups, said in a statement Thursday that survivors of Breivik's attacks had voiced concern regarding his ""status as an inspirational figure among far-right extremists.""""[This status] underlines the need for greater action to target the dissemination of known extremist propaganda with clear links to violence on online platforms,"" said David Ibsen, CEP executive director. ""The continued presence of far-right views online, along with greater exposure to extremist content over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, is of particular concern.""According to Ravndal, research indicates that within Norway the far right has not gained much appeal overall since the attacks and has been unable to turn out supporters in any numbers on the streets.""Of course in Norway, as everywhere else, online activity has grown over these 10 years,"" he said. ""But whether that reflects a substantial increase of far-right activity or simply mirrors the growth of social media on the internet, that's very difficult to say.""Shooting spreeOn that quiet summer day in 2011, Breivik drove a van packed with a homemade fertilizer bomb into Oslo and parked it outside a government office. A few minutes later, it exploded, killing eight people, injuring many more and damaging several buildings.Firefighters work at the site of the explosion near government buildings in the Norwegian capital, Oslo, on July 22, 2011.Breivik, meanwhile, had set off by car on the 25-mile trip to Utoya Island, where a Labour Party summer youth camp was taking place. Posing as a police officer who was checking on security following the Oslo attack, he caught a ferry to the island and carried out a shooting spree in which 69 people died -- most of them teenagers. Many others were seriously wounded.During his trial, Breivik boasted of being an ultranationalist who killed his victims to fight multiculturalism in Norway, saying he acted out of ""necessity"" to prevent the ""Islamization"" of the country under the ruling center-left Labour Party.A court ruling meant his testimony was not televised, denying him a chance to broadcast his views to a wide audience. But Breivik believed his writings would inspire right-wing terrorists to follow in his footsteps.Police and emergency services gather following the massacre at a summer youth camp on July 22, 2011 on Utoya Island, Norway.While parts of his three-book manifesto were lifted from other sources, such as the writings of ""Unabomber"" Ted Kaczynski in the United States, Breivik also detailed his meticulous, years-long planning and gave strategic and operational advice.According to Professor Matthew Feldman, director of the UK-based Centre for Analysis of the Radical Right (CARR), Breivik's document can still ""easily"" be found in the darker reaches of the internet despite efforts to remove it.That manifesto was ""paradigmatic,"" Feldman said, ""not just because it showed what one individual can do in terms of the horrific loss of life"" but also in its targeting of Muslims and what Breivik called ""cultural Marxism.""Even more importantly, Feldman said, Breivik's case showed the dangers posed by lone-wolf actors who self-radicalize online through networks of like-minded individuals and carry out their preparations for violent attacks online, making them very hard to detect. Ad hoc extremist groups come into focus in post-January 6 criminal charges At the same time, Feldman said, there has been the ""slow rise, some would call it mainstreaming, of right-wing extremism,"" helped in part by exposure on right-wing media platforms. ""For some it was laid bare on January 6 in the United States [in the assault on the Capitol] but it's something that's been gathering pace slowly but steadily in recent decades,"" he said.Despite this backdrop, Breivik's actions and manifesto have gained limited traction, according to Ravndal. His analysis for C-REX indicates that ""in the beginning the far-right across the board rejected him,"" said Ravndal. An online support network that was established for Breivik later collapsed. It was only with the emergence of online forums like 4chan and 8chan that Breivik once again started to get positive mentions, Ravndal said.""The main finding, all in all, both when it comes to tactics but also for political, ideological support, is that it's been surprisingly little,"" he said. ""It's been possible to find support, but fortunately less than one might have worried about initially considering the high death toll and all the attention these attacks got globally.""Societal impact Today, the debate has shifted in parts of Norwegian society to broader ideological questions, Ravndal said.Some -- particularly in the youth wing of the Labour Party -- feel that there has not been a reckoning with the country's far-right movement, the biggest player in which is the populist, right-wing Progress Party, he said. Breivik had been a member of the Progress Party when he was younger but the party distanced itself from him after the attack.In a joint statement published on the party's website earlier this month, party leader Sylvi Listhaug and deputy leaders Ketil Solvik-Olsen and Terje Søviknes pushed back against any suggestion that the Progress Party was not united with other Norwegians in rejecting Breivik's attitudes and actions. ""We must all stand together against violent extremism -- regardless of whether it comes from the 'far right', 'far left' or extreme interpretations of religion,"" the statement said. ""Only the extremists will win if we exclude each other from the grief after July 22 and weaken the unity around the struggle for democracy, freedom of expression and equality.""Labour has promised that if it wins power in elections this September, it will set up a new commission to look at radicalization. There is also debate about whether the attack should be interpreted as an attack on Norwegian society as a whole, or as an attack on the Labour Party specifically, Ravndal said. ""Today, some within the Labour Party perhaps feel that that part of the story has been neglected a bit.""Leader of the youth organization of the Labour Party (AUF) Astrid Hoem, left, Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven, center, and leader of the Norwegian Labor Party Jonas Gahr Store, right, lay flowers at a memorial on Utoya island, on July 21, 2021.Feldman considers that Norway's response was shaped by the sense that the perpetrator was ""one of their own,"" as were the victims, without a sense of ""otherness"" to force a more multicultural response.""Norway essentially asked itself this question, and it's a very valid one ... 'How did Norwegian society produce such a monster?'"" he said. ""It's a very inward-looking question.""By contrast, he said, New Zealand took a much more global approach as it looked at what led up to the Christchurch attacks. This was in part because Tarrant, an Australian, had targeted worshipers at mosques, many of whom were foreign-born.At the same time, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's response, including wearing a hijab to meet survivors and relatives of those killed, was central in bringing all New Zealanders together in support of the victims as fellow citizens, he said.Just weeks later, New Zealand collaborated with France to produce the ""Christchurch Call"" -- a commitment by governments and tech companies to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online -- and subsequently worked with the United States and United Nations to keep the issue on the agenda, Feldman said.He hopes to win further commitments to counter extremist content online at an event he is involved with in Bergen, Norway, next month. Members of the public pay their respects near Utoya Island on July 24, 2011 in Norway.Breivik's ideology 'is still out there'Speaking to CNN earlier this month, Stoltenberg spoke of the shock he felt as he realized the scale of the horrors perpetrated by Breivik --  and the personal sadness it brought, since he knew many of the victims.He also stood by the message he delivered to the nation as it was still reeling from the July 22 attacks.Norway's then-Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, left, embraces Eskil Pedersen, leader of the Norwegian Labour Youth league and a survivor of the Utoya attack, on July 23, 2011.""I still believe that our answer was the right one,"" Stoltenberg told CNN. ""[Breivik] wanted to attack our free, open democratic societies. So the best response is more openness, more democracy, because then we prove that he is not winning, we are winning.  ""He demonstrated hatred. The best response to hatred is love. So ... I really welcomed the strong message from the people of Norway, as (we) have seen also in many other countries that have been attacked, that we stand up for our values."" That notwithstanding, Stoltenberg does not believe that Breivik has been entirely defeated.""He is convicted, he is in prison. But his ideology, that is still out there. And therefore we need to continue -- I think we never will be in the position where we can say that we have won the fight, we can close the chapter fighting against extremism."" Since 2011, Norway has implemented measures to protect -- as far as possible -- against such attacks in the future, Stoltenberg said. And, he added, Brevik -- whose 21-year sentence could be extended in the future if he still poses a threat -- has lost in one key respect.""We have to understand that the purpose of this attack was to change Norway fundamentally. And ... yes, of course, this will be part of Norway's history,"" he said. ""It will be part of who we are as long as we exist. But fundamentally, it has not changed who we are.""CNN's Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report."

The memo states the team with the outbreak will be responsible for any additional expenses incurred by the opposing team.

Local media reports said he made anti-Semitic comments in a 1998 comedy act about the Holocaust.Kobayashi later apologized for his comments in a statement.Read More""Indeed, as pointed out, in the video software that was released in 1998 to introduce young comedians, a skit script I wrote contained an extremely inappropriate expression,"" the comedian added.""I understand that my foolish choice of words at the time was a mistake, and I regret it,"" Kobayashi said, adding that he was grateful he was able to be involved in the ceremony.Earlier this week, the composer for both the opening and closing ceremonies for the 2020 Olympics. -- Japanese musician Keigo Oyamada -- announced his intention to step down after old interviews of bullying behavior resurfaced.Oyamada -- who is also known by the stage moniker Cornelius -- has faced a social media backlash after comments made in the 1990s with Japanese magazine Rockin'On Japan recently began circulating online. In the comments, he described abusing fellow classmates with apparent disabilities while at school.A general view over the National Stadium in Tokyo.Putting on a showIn 2012, Academy Award winning film director Danny Boyle created an Opening Ceremony which featured David Beckham in a boat, red double-decker buses and even Queen Elizabeth II jumping out a helicopter with James Bond.In 2016, Rio's Opening Ceremony was bright and vibrant in a celebration of Brazil's multiculturalism and culture, with segments dedicated to climate change and conservation.Now it's time for Tokyo and Japan to put on a show for the watching world.The Opening Ceremony for this year's Summer Games -- which were delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic -- will take place on July 23 in Tokyo's Olympic Stadium.Usually held in a stadium full of ecstatic fans, this year's ceremony will have athletes from across the globe parading in a near empty venue after it was announced that fans would not be allowed to attend because of rising Covid-19 cases in Japan.The Olympic cauldron is lit during the Opening Ceremony at the 2012 Summer Olympics.""The most difficult part of the process was that the postponement meant a simplification of the ceremonies and the message had to be drastically revised,"" said Takayuki Hioki, Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee executive producer of ceremonies.""After nearly five years of planning, we found ourselves suddenly having to rethink everything. This was the biggest challenge,"" said Hioki.Due to restrictions, only a select number of officials and some dignitaries will be present for the Friday's ceremony.Tokyo 2020 Opening Ceremony: Number of participants per countrySOUTH KOREA 26 athletes at Opening Ceremony Flag bearers: Hwang Sun-woo and Kim Yeon-koug Total members of team: 354 (232 of which are athletes) CANADAApprox 30 to 40 athletes at Opening CeremonyFlag Bearers: Miranda Ayim and Nathan HirayamaTotal members of team: 370 INDIA50 members at Opening Ceremony (athletes and officials)Total members of India Team at the Games: 228 (119 of which are athletes)AUSTRALIAApproximately 50 members at Opening Ceremony (athletes and officials)Total members team: 472 athletes (total members unavailable)Tokyo 2020 spokesman Hidemasa Nakamura told CNN that about 950 VIPs will take part in the event. The total will include around 800 foreign guests and 150 from Japan, CNN affiliate TV Asahi reported. Japan's Emperor Naruhito, who will declare the Olympics open at the ceremony, will be attending without any other member of the imperial family, according to the Imperial Household Agency.The agency says that the decision was made in keeping with the plans for other Olympic officials who are also attending unaccompanied by their spouses.With all the struggles and difficulties that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has faced to stage the Games in the midst of the ongoing pandemic, president Thomas Bach believes it will be a moment of ""joy and relief.""""I think It will be a moment of joy and relief when entering the stadium,"" Bach said during a press conference.""A moment of joy in particular for the athletes because I know how much they're longing for this moment. They can finally be there and can enjoy this moment under very special circumstances. And a feeling of relief because the road to this Opening Ceremony was not the easiest one.""However as Covid-19 cases continue to rise in Tokyo, there will be notable absentees on Friday. Japanese car manufacture Toyota has confirmed its CEO, Akio Toyoda, will not be attending the opening ceremony.""The motto of the Tokyo 2020 Games is ""United by Emotion,"" added Hioki.""We spent a lot of time and energy struggling and what we came up with was 'achieving personal best,' 'unity in diversity,' 'connecting to tomorrow'; in other words, the Games vision.""We have created something with a strong message that will resonate with the audience. It's more about the emotional connection than the excitement.""We took the athletes very seriously. We had to make sure the athletes who finally have come from abroad don't feel anxious, and yet we want them to be energised and ready for competition.""Marco Balich, a former opening ceremonies executive producer and now a senior advisor to the Tokyo ceremony, told Reuters that Friday's event will be a ""sobering"" ceremony.""Nevertheless with beautiful Japanese aesthetics. Very Japanese but also in sync with the sentiment of today, the reality,"" said Balich, who was in charge of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.The Tokyo2020 Twitter account on Wednesday tweeted a sneak peak of what to expect at Friday's event, teasing a 30-second clip of an orchestra playing music, a drone, and choreographed dancing.Toyoda runs with the Olympic torch during the Tokyo Olympic Games Torch Relay.Carrying the flagBearing your country's flag as you and your fellow athletes make their way into a stadium for an opening ceremony is one of the greatest honors bestowed on any Olympian.For Team USA, four-time Olympic basketball gold medalist Sue Bird and baseball player Eddy Alvarez have been given that honor after they were named as their country's flag bearers for the opening ceremony, the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee announced Wednesday.""It's an incredible honor to be selected the flag bearer for Team USA,"" said Bird in a statement. ""I know what that means because I got to witness Dawn Staley go through it when she was selected in 2004.""It's an honor that is bigger than the moment in that you've been selected by your fellow Team USA athletes to represent the entire delegation, and it will last forever.""Bird and Alvarez were voted as flag bearers by Team USA athletes. The opening ceremony on Friday will mark the first time the US delegation will have two flag-bearers.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosA split of Bird and Alvarez.""It is an honor and a privilege to be named as one of the flag bearers by my fellow Team USA athletes for the Opening Ceremony,"" said Alvarez.""Being a first-generation Cuban-American, my story represents the American Dream. My family has sacrificed so much for me to have the opportunity to wave this flag proudly.""I am grateful for my time with US Speedskating and USA Baseball, as well as for all of my teammates, and I am humbled to lead Team USA into the Tokyo Olympic Games.""For Team GB, Olympic champions Hannah Mills and Mohamed Sbihi have been selected as the team's flagbearers for Friday's opening ceremony.Sailor Mills and rower Sbihi will both be defending their Olympic titles they won four years ago in Rio.

The Olympics' opening ceremony is Friday and the gymnastics competition is scheduled for Saturday through August 3.Read MoreEaker, an 18-year-old alternate member of the gymnastics team, recently arrived in Japan for the Games. Despite displaying no symptoms and being vaccinated, Eaker had multiple tests come back positive after she arrived in Japan, her father, Mark Eaker, said. Athletes could face the warmest Olympic Games in decadesHe said she will have to isolate in a hotel for 10 days before being allowed to return to the United States. ""I know she's disappointed, but at this point she says she's kind of bored because she's stuck in her room not being able to do anything, can't practice or anything like that. She says she's bored and just looking forward to coming home,"" Mark Eaker told KMBC. ""The biggest disappointment is that this takes her out of it completely.""A second alternate on the gymnastics team is also in isolation after having had close contact, USA Gymnastics said in a statement. USA Gymnastics did not identify her but her club coach said it was Leanne Wong. Coach Al Fong says Wong, 17, has not been vaccinated. Wong also feels fine and has no symptoms, Fong said.Eaker and Wong both train with Fong at Gage Gymnastics in the Kansas City, Missouri area, according to KMBC.USA Gymnastics said its Olympic athletes were moved to separate lodging accommodations and a separate training facility on Monday, as originally planned, where they will continue preparations for competition.Basketball player was also fully vaccinatedKatie Lou Samuelson, left, and Kara Eaker, both tested positive for Covid-19 days before the start of the Olympics.Samuelson said she was ""heartbroken"" to come down with Covid-19 because she was fully vaccinated.""I am devastated to share that after getting sick with COVID-19, I will not be able to go and compete in Tokyo,"" Samuelson wrote on her Instagram account.""Competing in the Olympics has been a dream of mine since I was a little girl and I hope that someday soon, I can come back and fulfill that dream.""Samuelson, 24, who plays professionally with the WNBA's Seattle Storm, has had her roster spot filled by Jackie Young.USA Basketball tweeted, ""Our hearts are broken for Lou.

About 11,000 athletes from around the world will stay in 21 residential buildings of the Olympic Village. The rising number of Covid-19 cases tied to the competition has fueled concerns as to whether the Olympics can be safely held during the ongoing pandemic.Japan grappled with a second wave of infections in the spring, with numbers peaking in April and May with close to 6,000 newly recorded cases per day. Cases began falling in June, but have risen again in recent weeks.Organizers announced this month that the Tokyo venues will not have spectators because of the city's coronavirus state of emergency -- an unprecedented move, according to an International Olympic Committee spokesman.USA Gymnastics outlines Covid protocolsOn June 27, USA Gymnastics announced its women's artistic gymnastics team roster and included Eaker, Wong, Kayla DiCello and Emma Malabuyo as the replacement athletes.USA Gymnastics provided background information on the protocols the women's gymnastics team had been observing. Among the protocols:• Japanese Covid-19 chaperones oversaw the delegation's movements at the training facility and hotel.  • The delegation was not allowed outside the hotel grounds and was kept away from hotel guests via different pathways through the hotel. • The delegation had designated restrooms not used by anyone else in the training facility.  • Since the positive test, all US Olympic athletes and coaches now have their own hotel rooms. Previously, replacement athletes were rooming with other replacement athletes, and competitors were sharing rooms with competitors. • Dining has been in a private dining room, with everyone seated 6 feet apart, facing the same direction. Team athletes and coaches sat on one side of the dining room while replacement athletes and coaches sat on the other. These protocols will continue for Games athletes in Tokyo, but remaining replacement athletes will eat in separate rooms.• Covid-19 saliva tests are collected every morning from all delegation members. Health assessments are completed by all delegation members each morning. Temperatures are taken and recorded every morning.

His previous test, taken the day before departing for Tokyo, was negative.Following a report in Czech media that he had not been vaccinated against Covid-19 despite being eligible for the shot and despite the fact that the COCe ""strongly encouraged"" all participants to get vaccinated, Voracek issued a statement in which he denied breaking any rules.""The organizers stipulated their rules for athletes and those accompanying them.

After years of research, the 29-year-old baron would go public with his idea to revive the Olympic Games of Ancient Greece in the modern era. He'd chosen the old Sorbonne in Paris and the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the French athletics association to deliver his speech. It was a grand setting for a big idea: a sporting competition to bring nations together and learn from one another -- to promote internationalism and world peace, no less. The speech fell flat.The audience was ""not negative, but there was no support,"" says David Wallechinsky, author and a founding member of the International Society of Olympic Historians. ""He had a good speech and the wrong audience -- an audience that was not sympathetic enough or open minded enough.""""Coubertin realized that he hadn't pulled it off, but he was persistent,"" Wallechinsky adds. ""He realized that idealism wasn't enough. He had to get down to the nitty gritty and get the work done.""Read MoreThat the speech is so revered -- the original 14-page manuscript went for $8.8 million in 2019, becoming the most valuable item of sports memorabilia ever sold at auction -- is testament to what happened next.The Olympic spiritThe original Olympic Games manifesto, written in 1892 by Pierre de Coubertin, on public display at Sotheby's in Century City, California, on October 23, 2019. In 1892, France was yet to take organized sports to heart, says Stephan Wassong, an expert in the life of Coubertin and head of the Institute of Sport History at the German Sport University Cologne. Physical activity and organized sports were part of the military program but not the school curriculum, unlike the US and Britain.  Coubertin, a strong advocate for sports' educational value, believed it ""was good for the brain"" and that ""the mind and the body could work together, and they helped each other,"" Wassong explains. He'd traveled to England, where sports were already a part of students' daily lives at boarding schools, and where local events like the Wenlock Olympian Games, established in 1850, brought together competitors across a number of disciplines.But it was where sports could dovetail with his other passion that gave Coubertin's idea an edge. A sworn internationalist whose writings detail an ""awakening"" at the World Fair of 1878, he became involved in the world peace movement, which like so many other movements, was centered in Paris at the time.Having witnessed Englishman Hodgson Pratt propose an international student exchange to promote tolerance, at the 1891 World Peace Conference in Rome, ""Coubertin took up this idea and ... linked it with sport,"" says Wassong. How one speech forever connected Lou Gehrig, baseball and this fatal diseaseThis ""wasn't a popular concept,"" says Wallechinsky, particularly among leaders in an age of colonialism and competition between European nations' imperial ambitions. But Coubertin believed in his idea. When the night at the Sorbonne came, the speech latched on to the popular revival of all things Hellenic, and used the reputation of the Ancient Olympic Games to support his idea. Coubertin praised the advancement of sport from Germany to Sweden, Britain to the US, lamented France's slow start, and called sport the ""free trade of the future.""Sport was put on the same pedestal as the scientific and engineering innovations of the day: ""It is clear that the telegraph, railways, the telephone, the passionate research in science, congresses and exhibitions have done more for peace than any treaty or diplomatic convention,"" Coubertin said. ""Well, I hope that athletics will do even more. Those who have seen 30,000 people running through the rain to attend a football match will not think that I am exaggerating.""Related: Mark Spitz on seven ways to survive the Olympic GamesThe speech ""clearly laid down the educational fundamentals of the Olympic idea -- of Olympism,"" says Wassong, ""and its mission to build a better world through sport.""But though his lofty rhetoric fell on deaf ears that night, Coubertin had the will and the resources, and campaigned around Europe for his modern Olympic Games.Two years later he returned to the old Sorbonne, and in the very same room, plans were formalized for the first Games. His message had finally been heard. In 1896, the Olympics were reborn in Athens, Greece.Left to right: Willabald Gebhardt of Germany, Baron Pierre de Coubertin of France, Jiri Guth of Bohemia, President Dimitros Vikelas of Greece, Ferenc Kemey of Hungary, Aleksei Butovksy of Russia, and Viktor Balck of Sweden at the first meeting of the International Olympic Committee, organized for the 1896 Olympic Games.A complex legacyCoubertin was not without considerable flaws. He did not initially believe women should participate in the Games (women first competed in 1900) and with his upper-class mentality he held ""at best condescending, and at worst, actually racist"" views of some countries, says Wallechinsky.He also said that the Olympic movement ""needed constant updating, and to be adapted to the prevailing zeitgeist,"" Wassong notes. So, while the movement is indebted to Coubertin, certain views he held should, by his own admission, be gladly left behind and disassociated from the Games.Related: Russian oligarch donates $8.8 million Olympic manifesto to museumIn 1896, 12 countries competed. For Tokyo 2020, invitations to the Games were sent to over 200 nations, states and territories. Today the Games is almost unrecognizable in its scale, diversity and degree of sporting prowess. But the spirit of Coubertin's speech lives on in its friendly competition.""We're going to have 11,000 or so athletes in Tokyo,"" says Wallechinsky. ""The vast majority -- I would say 80% or more -- will have no chance whatsoever of winning a medal, and they know it ... But most of them are there to set a personal record, to set a national record, to do the best they can. I think that de Coubertin would have loved that."""

The opening ceremony will be held Friday, but Olympic events typically begin before the formal start for scheduling purposes. These Olympics are expected to be a competition unlike the world has ever seen. Organizers decided to push ahead despite Japan's struggle to rein in the spread of Covid-19, and with just two days until the formal opening, it is still not clear whether the public health measures in place are enough to prevent the Games from becoming a global superspreader event. Athletes have already begun arriving, and more than 70 cases tied to the Olympics have been identified. American Cat Osterman celebrates with teammates during the softball game between Italy and the US on Wednesday.Organizers had spent months preparing for 11,000 athletes from 200 countries and thousands of journalists to descend on a single city, a potential logistical nightmare in the middle of a pandemic and without the support of the public. Opinion polls in Japan show most people oppose holding a major sporting event during a public health crisis.Read MoreWorld Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is in Tokyo for the Games, expressed confidence Japan could safely host the event in a speech to the International Olympic Committee (IOC), though its plans would be ""put to the test."" ""There is no zero risk in life; there is only more risk, or less risk. And you have done your best,"" he said. The Olympic village is prepped with coronavirus testing and health centers, with signs reminding residents to wear face masks and keep at least 1 meter (about 3.3 feet) away from each other. Athletes will be contact-traced and tested for Covid-19 daily; if they test positive, they will be taken to an isolation facility outside the village, and will not be able to compete.When Tokyo extended its coronavirus state of emergency until August 22, the IOC took the unprecedented step of barring fans from attending the competition.Japan's chief Olympics official, Toshiro Muto, did not rule out canceling the quadrennial sporting event last minute on Tuesday.JUST WATCHED'This was my final curtain bow': Athlete's Olympic dreams crushed by CovidReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'This was my final curtain bow': Athlete's Olympic dreams crushed by Covid 02:36The plan was that those participating in the Games would live isolated from the Japanese public, with athletes living in 21 residential buildings.

""There seems to be some sort of interaction between guests and visitors and also local people.""The IOC and Tokyo 2020 organizers did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on Shibuya's remarks.Friday's opening ceremony is expected to draw a far smaller crowd than previous editions.

However, United States First Lady Jill Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron are both expected to be there. Brisbane set to get the nod The IOC is expected to approve on Wednesday its newest Olympic host city: Brisbane, Australia. Brisbane is expected to host the 2032 Olympics.Brisbane will likely be awarded the 2032 Summer Games, as it was the only candidate in the running after being formally approved to host the Games in June.

The move is in response to the European Union which lambasted the new measure by the member state.   In a Facebook video on Wednesday, the hardline leader outlined a five-question vote that will ask the public if they support the ""promotion"" of content related to sexual orientation to children. Orbán is urging the public to vote ""no."" ""In the past weeks, Brussels has clearly attacked Hungary over its child protection law. Hungarian laws do not permit sexual propaganda in kindergartens, schools, on television and in advertisements,"" Orban said in a Facebook video.In his announcement, he referred to a referendum five year ago in which Hungary rejected the EU's refugee resettlement plan but failed to reach a voter turnout threshold, making the referendum not legally binding. ""Then, a referendum and the common will of the people stopped Brussels,"" he said. ""We have already succeeded once and together we will succeed again."" Read MoreParticipants gather near parliament in Budapest on June 14, 2021, during a demonstration against the Hungarian government's draft bill seeking to ban the ""promotion"" of homosexuality in schools.Members of the European Parliament and other European leaders have criticized the new policy, with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte saying that Hungary has ""no place in the EU."" CNN learned that during the last closed-door meeting of EU leaders, Luxembourg's Prime Minister, Xavier Bettel, starkly warned Orban: ""My grandfather was Jewish, I'm gay and can live freely. And then I read this law. I know what happens when you turn people into a minority."" Seventeen other member states pointedly signed a letter to the presidents of the EU institutions, reiterating their support for human rights as outlined in Article 2 of the treaties of the European Union. The European Commission last week announced infringement proceedings against Orban's government in relation to the law.What the ballot paper will ask1. Do you support the holding of presentations in public education institutions to introduce minors to topics on sexual orientation without the authorization of their parents?2. Do you support the promotion of gender reassignment treatments for minors?3. Do you support gender reassignment treatments being made available to minors?4. Do you support minors being shown, without any restriction, media content of a sexual nature that is capable of influencing their development?5. Do you support minors being shown media content that demonstrates gender reassignment?The law bans all educational materials and programs for children that are considered to promote homosexuality and gender reassignment.It has been condemned by many EU leaders as being homophobic and has prompted intense criticism from human rights groups and opposition parties. On the day it passed, crowds gathered in Budapest outside  parliament to protest the bill.""In the past weeks, Brussels has clearly attacked Hungary over its child protection law. Hungarian laws do not permit sexual propaganda in kindergartens, schools, on television and in advertisements,"" Orban said in the video.Orban has maintained that the law -- approved in parliament last month -- is not about violating LGBTQ rights as critics argue, but about preserving parents' rights to choose how to educate their children.The Hungarian government also announced on Wednesday that proposals to hold referendums are allowed again after being suspended due to Covid-19.  A spokesperson for the European Commission said it would not comment on Orban's statement -- as is standard practice when any member state announces a referendum -- but referred CNN to the infringement procedure it launched last week."

It was Rose Lavelle who had the chance to equalize, but her header from a long ball into the box crashed against the outside of the post.That it was the reigning world champion's only real chance of note in the first half was a testament to Sweden's superiority, the yellow shirts swarming the US players in midfield and not allowing them a moment to relax on the ball.The only negative from Sweden's perspective was that it had only managed to open up a one-goal lead -- would the team rue that profligacy in front of goal?The US players look bemused after conceding the second.USWNT coach Vlatko Andonovski made two substitutions at the start of the second half, with the vastly experienced Carli Lloyd and Julie Ertz coming on to replace Alex Morgan and Samantha Mewis.Ertz seemed to immediately breath new life into the US team, but just when it looked like the momentum of the game was shifting, Sweden doubled its advantage.Blackstenius this time picked up the scraps at the far post after a Swedish corner caused mayhem in the US box and poked the ball past Naeher into the roof of the net.From there, it only got worse for the US team.After substitute Megan Rapinoe hit the post when she perhaps she should have scored, Sweden put an exclamation mark next to its performance as Hurtig rose high in the box to head home from Hanna Glas' cross.Stina Blackstenius got her Olympics off to a dream start with a brace.The camera cut to the US bench where a bemused Andonovski sat helplessly on the bench.He now has plenty to ponder now ahead of the tough upcoming fixtures against New Zealand and Australia should the US want to avoid a shock early exit."

It found that Swedish men on average were responsible for 16% more greenhouse gases than women, despite the fact that men only spend 2% more on goods in total than women do. The research was based on official consumer spending figures from 2012 -- the most recent data available.The study gave a number of reasons why men are responsible for higher carbon emissions despite spending a similar amount to women. The Northwest heat wave is 'unprecedented.' Here's what's pushing it into uncharted territory.It said women tended to spend money on ""low-emitting products,"" such as healthcare, furnishings and clothes, while men spent 70% of their money on what the study called ""greenhouse gas-intensive items,"" including fuel for cars.

Scientists are worried by how fast the climate crisis has amplified extreme weather""Policies -- for example, in transportation -- should be targeted to men to discourage them from spending so much on fuel, from using cars so much. It's essential for governments, in their messaging, to explain to men how high the emissions are that their expenditure is causing.""Carlsson-Kanyama also said she's noticed that it ""makes people uncomfortable to discuss the fact that men and women affect the environment differently."" Asmae Ourkiya, a doctoral researcher in ecofeminism and environmental justice at the University of Limerick in Ireland, echoed Carlsson-Kanyama's point about the impact that fixed gender roles -- within which men are more likely to spend their money on cars and fuel and to eat more meat, for example -- have on the environment. Men's ""masculine identities became heavily associated with fossil fuel extraction and consumption ... and resistance to sustainable diets,"" they told CNN.Enormous scale of destruction is revealed as water subsides after historic western Europe floodingThe study's publication comes just weeks after the devastating consequences of climate change were laid bare across the US and Canada, when record-breaking heat waves left many dead. And the EU last week announced its bold new plan for climate action -- the ""Fit for 55"" initiative that aims to wean its members off of fossil fuels.Ourkiya and Carlsson-Kanyama said world governments must also consider how climate change affects men and women differently, as not only do women have smaller carbon footprints than men, they are also, according to the United Nations, more vulnerable to climate change -- a fact that Carlsson-Kanyama says ""should be reflected in the fight against climate disasters."""

According to Cummings, Johnson said: ""I'm going to see the Queen ... that's what I do every Wednesday. Sod this. I'm going to go and see her."" ""You can't go and see the Queen. What if you go and see her and give the Queen coronavirus? You obviously can't go,"" Cummings responded. ""I just said, 'If you give her coronavirus and she dies, what are you going to [do]? You can't do that. You can't risk that. That's completely insane.'""""And [Johnson] said -- he basically just hadn't thought it through -- 'Yeah ... I can't go.'""Read MoreThe Queen went into isolation with Prince Philip at Windsor Castle, outside London, soon after the purported exchange described by Cummings. It has since emerged that both Prince Charles and Prince William, second and third in line to the throne, both had the virus in the early stages of the pandemic. A Downing Street spokesperson flatly denied Cummings's claims. Boris Johnson's former chief adviser launches extraordinary attack on UK government's 'disastrous' handling of pandemicIn the wide-ranging interview with the BBC, set to air Tuesday, Cummings accused his old boss of putting ""his own political interests ahead of people's lives"" through his handling of the pandemic. The adviser claimed that Johnson was willing to let the disease ""wash through the country"" in order to stop the economy from falling apart because he believed the people dying were ""essentially all over 80,"" and therefore less economically active. Cummings also claimed that Johnson rebuffed the advice of his most senior scientific and medical advisers to impose tougher restrictions, and pointed to the right-wing media's calls for fewer restrictions when justifying his actions. According to Cummings, the Prime Minister at one point called the Daily Telegraph, a right-leaning newspaper for which Johnson has worked on and off in various roles since the 1980s, his ""real boss.""Responding to the allegations, a Downing Street spokesperson told CNN in a statement that since ""the start of the pandemic, the Prime Minister has taken the necessary action to protect lives and livelihoods, guided by the best scientific advice. The government he leads has delivered the fastest vaccination rollout in Europe, saved millions of jobs through the furlough scheme and prevented the NHS from being overwhelmed through three national lockdowns."" The interview is the latest in a string of allegations made by Cummings since departing from his job in Downing Street last November following an internal power struggle. Boris Johnson denies disrespecting Covid-19 victims. But the political crises are piling up.The most significant moment in the Cummings-Johnson spat came in May of this year, when Cummings gave evidence to Members of Parliament. During the session with MPs, he said on the record that Johnson would rather see ""bodies pile high"" than impose lockdown restrictions, that the Prime Minister failed to take the disease seriously at the earliest stages of the pandemic, and at one stage offered to have England's chief medical officer ""inject him with Covid"" live on air to prove it was nothing to worry about.Cummings' comments were rebuffed at the time by Downing Street and allies of the Prime Minister suggested to CNN that the former aide's credibility was undermined by his clear personal vendetta against the Prime Minister. The appointment of Cummings, who was the mastermind of the 2016 Brexit campaign, has been one of the most controversial aspects of Johnson's tenure as Prime Minister. During his time as an adviser, he severely damaged Johnson's reputation when it emerged he had traveled hundreds of miles after displaying symptoms of Covid-19, despite the country being in a national lockdown. Johnson stood by Cummings, costing him public approval."

But they might yet win the culture war,"(CNN)This year's Euro 2020 tournament has become a national talking point in the UK -- but not just about football.Before England lost the final to Italy in a penalty shootout, London's Wembley Stadium had hosted seven Euro 2020 matches, an advantage that helped convince English fans ""football's coming home,"" referencing the chorus to the ""Three Lions"" song, written when England hosted the European Championships in 1996.  Both before and during the tournament, England's players took the knee before each game's kick-off, an act Gareth Southgate's team repeatedly said showed their support of anti-racism.The gesture was booed by some fans, notably in two friendly matches before Euro 2020 and also during England's opening fixture against Croatia. It was a sound all too familiar to Premier League footballers, who had received a similar reception ahead of the FA Cup final in May between Leicester City and Chelsea, when players also took the knee.England players look on in a penalty shoot out during the UEFA Euro 2020 Championship Final between Italy and England at Wembley Stadium on July 11, 2021.In June, UK Home Secretary Priti Patel accused the national team of engaging in ""gesture politics"" by taking the knee. She told GB News that fans had a right to boo players, adding, ""that's a choice for them, quite frankly."" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, along with other lawmakers in his government, also failed to condemn such fans. Read MoreBut when Italy defeated England in that penalty shootout, some fans' hostility resurfaced in the form of online racist abuse targeted at England players Marcus Rashford, Bukayo Saka and Jadon Sancho, after they each missed penalties.Patel tweeted she was ""disgusted"" by the abuse, only for England international Tyrone Mings to call out the UK Home Secretary.""You don't get to stoke the fire at the beginning of the tournament by labelling our anti-racism message as 'Gesture Politics' & then pretend to be disgusted when the very thing we're campaigning against, happens,"" the 28-year-old wrote on Twitter.Patel and the Home Office declined to comment on Mings' post when CNN reached out, instead pointing to her tweet and her comments in the House of Commons on Monday condemning the racist abuse directed at the England players.Johnson and his cabinet now find themselves embroiled in a culture war, which potentially has political consequences.England and Italy players take the knee prior to the UEFA Euro 2020 Championship Final at Wembley Stadium on July 11, 2021.READ: Germany's Olympic soccer team walks off the pitch during friendly match over alleged racial abuse'Undeclared war on woke'And Johnson may find himself on the wrong side of history when attempting to use culture wars to cement his grip on power, according to political analyst Tim Bale, who told CNN Sport that the Prime Minister, Patel ""and some other government MPs did misjudge the situation right from the start.""""They're so concerned not to get on the wrong side of their culture war warriors, that they refused to condemn those who were booing England players taking the knee, and I think in so doing, actually misjudged the national mood on this,"" said Bale, who is Professor of Politics at Queen Mary University of London.""It's easy to see why they did it because they themselves are prosecuting a sort of undeclared war on woke,"" he added.Ian Blackford speaks during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons, London on Wednesday July 14, 2021.The opposition Labour Party has argued that the government's initial inaction served as inspiration for the continued racist abuse targeted at players.""Let me be clear. The Prime Minister and the Home Secretary gave license to the racists who booed the England players and are now racially abusing England players,"" Deputy Labour Leader Angela Rayner said in a tweet.""@BorisJohnson and @pritipatel are like arsonists complaining about a fire they poured petrol on. Total hypocrites,"" she added.Likewise, during the weekly Prime Minister's Questions session, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Johnson had given racism the ""green light,"" and was trying to ""stoke a culture war"" over the issue of players taking the knee.Scottish National Party Westminster leader Ian Blackford went even further, flagging comments Johnson had made when he worked as journalist, namely his previous use of racist language in a 2002 Daily Telegraph column. Johnson has since apologized that he offended people.""Can the Prime Minister tell us what sanctions he thinks would be appropriate for someone who publishes racist content, and it is shocking even to have to say this out loud, describing Africans as 'flag waving piccaninnies with watermelon smiles'?"" Blackford asked Johnson during Wednesday's PMQs.  ""The legacy of this Prime Minister's dog whistling has followed him into 10 Downing Street and it is now at the heart of this Tory government,"" added Blackford. ""The Prime Minister was clear before England's first game that he wanted to see everyone getting behind the team to cheer them on, not boo,"" a No. 10 spokesperson told CNN on Friday.""He has also been very clear that people should feel free to show their respect and show how much they condemn racism in this country, in any way that they choose,"" they said. ""Racism in any form has no place in our society and that's why we are introducing tough new laws to force social media companies to clamp down on it,"" added the spokesperson. Conservative MP Steve Baker suggested the party had misjudged over England players taking the knee.'I fear we are in danger'Even some Conservative supporters have suggested the party has mis-stepped over England players taking the knee. According to the Guardian, Albie Amankona, a co-founder of Conservatives Against Racism For Equality, sent a letter to party MPs on Tuesday, saying that ""too many"" had ""fundamentally misunderstood the gesture.""  ""I'm [...] continually surprised by the way that Conservative MPs continue to conflate those who want to take the knee with things like being anti-capitalism, Marxist, anti-police, anti-institution, anti-British. Even after the people that are for taking the knee actually say it's nothing to do with that at all,"" Amankona told BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday.""We should have listened and altered our stance on things, and maybe not been so stridently against it,"" Amankona added. Meanwhile, the Guardian also reported former minister and senior Tory backbencher Steve Baker wrote in a message to MPs on the Conservatives Against Racism For Equality group, ""Much as we can't be associated with calls to defund the police, we urgently need to challenge our own attitude to people taking a knee.""""I fear we are in danger of misrepresenting our own heart for those who suffer injustice,"" he added.  Bukayo Saka (right) and team mate Jadon Sancho (left) during the UEFA Euro 2020 Championship Group D match between Czech Republic and England at Wembley Stadium on June 22, 2021.Football's new generation These days a new generation of footballers are proactively using social media as a tool for increased social and political engagement, showing how those in power can be held to account under a much more public spotlight than ever before.Professor Bale said footballers are ""much more socially aware than perhaps they were a few years ago.""""Anyone who works with young people [...] knows that they're very savvy,"" he added. ""So it shouldn't really surprise anyone [...] that they're going to have views and they're going to express them quite strongly."" He isn't wrong. Before England's young football stars took to the stage at Euro 2020, they had raised awareness on other issues important to them. In June 2020, Marcus Rashford led a campaign against child hunger after the UK said it wouldn't provide free school meal vouchers for disadvantaged children during the summer holidays. Days later, the government reversed its decision.The Manchester United forward was subsequently praised by former U.S. President Barack Obama for his work tackling child food poverty. A year prior, Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho teamed up with Nike to build a state-of-the-art football pitch in south London, to help young players foster their footballing talents.England midfielders Jordan Henderson (left) and Jack Grealish (right) were two members of the squad who insisted it was important for the team to take the knee.In the past week, numerous England footballers, including captain Harry Kane and Chelsea midfielder Mason Mount, have taken to social media to speak out against the racist abuse endured by Rashford, Sancho and Saka.Before then, Premier League peers Jack Grealish and Jordan Henderson had insisted it was important for the team to take the knee in the fight against inequality and racial injustice.Responding to the racist abuse he had received, Sancho posted on Instagram, ""Hate will never win.""""I am proud of this England team and how we have united the whole nation in what has been a difficult 18 months for so many people,"" he added, saying the positive messages ""far outweighed the negative.""Saka also acknowledged the abuse on an Instagram post, ""I don't want any child or adult to have to receive the hateful and hurtful messages that me Marcus and Jadon have received this week. I knew instantly the kind of hate that I was about to receive.""There is no place for racism or hate of any kind in football or in any area of society and to the majority of people coming together to call out the people sending these messages, by taking action and reporting these comments to the police and by driving out the hate by being kind to one another, we will win.""People look at the messages of support and the newly repaired mural of England footballer Marcus Rashford in Manchester, England.After missing his penalty, a mural in Rashford's hometown was defaced with graffiti. However, fans and locals alike swamped the portrait with messages of love and support, thanking him for lifting the nation's spirit and continuing to carry himself with grace. According to a statement released by Greater Manchester Police (GMP) on Thursday, ""While the content of the vandalism is not believed to be of a racial nature, officers are keeping an open mind as to the motive behind defacing the artwork.""Superintendent Richard Timson, district commander for GMP's City of Manchester division, said: ""On Monday morning when we saw the damage done to the mural in Withington we were all left appalled, and we stand with the rest of the community whose solidarity against this vile abuse ever since has really shown the best of our city.""""Overwhelmed. Thankful. Lost for words,"" the football star posted on Instagram in response.A microcosm of society""Sport mirrors or reflects society, its virtues and vices, but, unlike a mirror, it is active; it affects what it is a reflection of,"" Jan Boxill writes in 'The Moral Significance of Sport.'If the events of the past few months have shown anything, it's that sport will always be a microcosm of society, reflecting the changing social mores across the electorate. ""We're long past the days where politicians could demand the sports people and celebrities keep out of politics, especially when they weren't parroting the line that those politicians approved of,"" Bale says. ""They have a direct line to the public through social media. Whether it's a good thing or not, it's now inevitable that politics and sport will mix."""

In May this year, he also qualified for the 10,000m after achieving a personal best of 27:22.70 at the Olympiastadion in Stockholm.  In search of a better lifeRead MoreBut his journey to the Olympics began way before 2019.Kimeli's mother left their home county of Uasin Gishu in Kenya and migrated to Belgium when he was four years old, working as a nurse in a local hospital. ""My mother was coming to Belgium to search for a better life,"" he says. At the time, he was left in his grandparents' care -- admitting that at such a tender age, he felt marooned by her absence. ""I think it was difficult to see why she was leaving for another country.""When Kimeli turned 15, he also left Uasin Gishu and reunited with his mother in Sint-Pieters-Leeuw. He says at first it was hard for them to foster a good relationship, as they hadn't seen each other for over a decade. ""It's a little strange to see your mother again after so long.""Having never stepped foot on a plane before, he arrived in the capital city wide-eyed yet apprehensive. Without a close knit community and unable to speak the local language, he struggled to fit in with his new environment.""The weather was so cold,"" he says. ""I didn't speak French, and I didn't speak Dutch. For me, everything was new.""There was also a difference in the community dynamic. In Kenya, Kimeli was used to spending time with his close-knit coterie, forging strong bonds through shared meals and regular conversations. But in Belgium, the lack of interaction with fellow residents made him feel isolated. ""Here you don't talk with your neighbors, it was a big difference.""Finding his feetA bored and lonely teenager, Kimeli was homesick for Kenya. ""I didn't like Belgium, I wanted to go back home,"" he says.  But his luck changed when his PE teachers spotted him running at a cross-country event. He was attending school to learn Dutch at the time but was having more success on the track than in the classroom.""I was winning every time ... two minutes ahead of the other schoolmates,"" he says. His PE teachers encouraged him to join a track club to harness his talent, though it took him some time to get to grips with the rules of the sport.In one of his first junior events, Kimeli ran one lap and began celebrating his finish, before realizing he had a few more to go until the end of the race.Kimeli says he started running once he set foot in Belgium, since harnessing stellar achievements across track events. ""When I arrived there at the start, I thought I was in front of the other athletes,"" he says. ""I think I was 25th place.""""Nobody told me it'd be two or three laps,"" he adds. ""It was funny."" Kimeli also tried his hand at football, but the language barrier proved too much of an obstacle.""It was difficult because you're playing with the guys who are speaking Dutch, and I didn't speak Dutch,"" he says. ""When they told me, 'Give me the pass, give me the ball,' I didn't understand."" Eventually he settled on running, as the solitary nature of the sport meant he only had to rely on himself.His mother bought him a pair of running shoes, and he began training in Hallerbos with his first coach, David Evenepoel. In 2011, Kimeli competed in his first international competition at the European Youth Olympics Festival in Turkey. Committing to an Olympic dreamTwo years later, Kimeli committed to his dream of going to the Olympics when he won a silver medal in the men's junior race at the European Cross Country Championships in Serbia. He had begun training with Tim Moriau, who was also encouraged by his result, telling him, ""'We're going to work hard and maybe one day you can go to the Olympics, maybe you can run with the big guys.'""I said, 'Coach, are you sure you want me to go to the Olympics?' He said [...] 'You have talent, just start training and focus on yourself,'"" Kimeli adds. ""That's the moment when I said to myself OK, if you take second place in the European championships, you'll have more progression.""When Kimeli (left) won a silver medal at the European Cross-Country championships in Serbia, he devoted himself to his Olympic dream, which he hopes to achieve in Tokyo this summer. Since then, he's achieved stellar finishes at multiple track events, earning a gold medal at the European Cross Country Championships in 2016, a silver medal at the same tournament in 2018, and most recently winning a silver medal at the European Athletics Indoor Championship. He's also had the opportunity to pass on his expertize to aspiring runners by captaining the Runners' lab Athletics Elite Men's Team, which provides professional infrastructure for top European athletes.""My role is to advise athletes and give them experience,"" says Kimeli. ""I try to motivate the other athletes.""'I want to make my family proud'This year, he's hoping to add to his silverware at Tokyo 2020, entering the competition as a seasoned middle-distance runner.""I've grown as an athlete,"" he says, ""I feel that mentally I'm much stronger.""Kimeli hadn't been introduced to the sport in Uasin Gishu, instead spending time in school and tending to cattle with his grandfather on his family's farm. Kimeli was born in Kenya, which has produced some of the world's most accomplished distance runners. ""When I was in Kenya, I had never run,"" he says.But perhaps his success on the track was predestined. Kenya has produced some of the most accomplished distance runners on the planet, including marathon world record holder Eliud Kipchoge and Olympic record holder Vivian Cheruiyot.When Kimeli was growing up, his grandfather doled out important life lessons that set him in good stead for his journey to becoming an Olympian. ""My grandfather was like my father,"" he says. ""He taught me, 'Isaac, in your life, you have to be smart. You have to respect people. Don't talk too much, just concentrate on yourself. Enjoy your life and work hard, and help your family. ""Don't forget what's important.'""His grandfather passed away soon after Kimeli left for Belgium, so he never got to see his grandson's success.He hopes to honor his grandfather's legacy at Tokyo 2020. Last year, Kimeli visited his family in Kenya, where he had the chance to commemorate his grandfather's memory by laying down the first school cross-country medal he ever won by his final resting place. ""I gave him the medal to make him proud.""He says his grandmother, who is thrilled by his achievements, calls him when she watches his races on TV, telling him, ""'Don't forget us.'""The absence of international spectators at the Games means his family is unlikely to be in the stadium, but he knows they'll be cheering him on at home. ""I want to make my family proud,"" he says. ""That's why I want to work hard, that's what gives me more motivation.""Running for BelgiumBy sharing his story, Kimeli hopes others will be inspired to push for their dreams, no matter where they come from. ""When I was in Kenya, I never dreamed that I could wear Adidas or Nike shoes,"" he says. ""I want to show other young people that everything is possible, and nobody is limited."" He has just as much gratitude for his new home as he does for his birthplace. ""I want to thank Belgium, they gave me a lot of opportunity,"" he says. ""Belgium changed me as a person, and also my life.""The middle distance runner is looking forward to representing Belgium this summer in the men's 5000m and 10000m. ""I know my blood is Kenyan, but in my heart, I'm running for Belgium.""With less than a month to go until the scheduled start date, Kimeli says his participation in the Games doesn't yet feel real. ""It's still a dream to go there, and understand how a young boy from Kenya who was running with no shoes [...] now he's going to the Olympics,"" he says. ""It's amazing, I still can't believe it. I will believe it when I'm in Tokyo."""

Here are some of the cases:• The recent Copa America and European football championships saw teams lose players who couldn't compete because of virus protocols.• Six players on the New York Yankees tested positive for the virus last week, forcing the postponement of the first MLB game after the All-Star Game break and forcing a number of lineup changes in the contests that did take place. It wasn't the first time the Yankees saw a cluster of cases.Read More• The Colorado Rockies announced Friday that several players, the manager and a coach would miss time because of MLB's Covid-19 and contact tracing protocolsAmerican gymnast Kara Eaker and basketball player Katie Lou Samuelson test positive for Covid-19 ahead of Olympics• The exhibition game for the US men's hoops team that was scheduled for Friday was canceled after USA Basketball announced Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal will miss the Olympics and Jerami Grant of the Detroit Pistons was placed under the organization's health and safety protocols.• Two members of the South African men's soccer team and a video analyst tested positive while at the Olympic Village. Now 21 team members considered close contacts of those athletes are in isolation or quarantine.• Tennis players Alex de Minaur of Australia and Coco Gauff of the United States tested positive, meaning they wouldn't compete in the Olympics. • Katie Lou Samuelson, a member of the US Olympic 3x3 women's basketball team, also will miss the Games because of Covid-19.• On Sunday, Kara Eaker, an alternate on the US women's gymnastics team, was placed in isolation after testing positive for the virus.But is the significant number of cases a sign of Covid in the world around us, or is there something different about sports competitions?""There's not a lot of places we test as frequently as we do with professional sports and college sports,"" Dr. Costi Sifri, an infectious disease physician and hospital epidemiologist at the University of Virginia, told CNN on Monday.He said it's not a bad thing that frequent testing of athletes is picking up what have often been notable numbers of asymptomatic cases.He said if he were an Olympic athlete, he would have gotten vaccinated -- which is not mandated -- but when he got to Tokyo he would act like he was unvaccinated. ""There are ways to do things safely,"" he said, pointing to wearing a mask during high-risk situations and attending social events only if they are held outside. The close proximity that athletes spend time in could be a breeding ground for infectious diseases, he said. It should be noted that vaccine programs vary in nations around the world, and not as much is known about some vaccines given in some countries, he added. And some teenage athletes might come from countries that don't vaccinate people that age, he said.CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, reporting from Tokyo, said the Olympics bring a unique challenge.

There will be no influx of fans to the country, as events will have no spectators for the events in the Tokyo and the venues in nearby prefectures. Athletes in Tokyo are being told to limit their movements to venues and the village. The rest of the strategy is the pillars of pandemic public health, the chair of Independent Expert Panel (IEP) for the International Olympic Committee told Gupta recently.A member of the Mexican delegation walks past Olympic rings at the entrance to Olympic Village.""Social distancing, physical distancing, wearing a mask and hand hygiene,"" Olympic Games health adviser Dr. Brian McCloskey said. ""They were always at the fundamental core of what we knew would reduce the risk of Covid during the Games. And then we started a layer on top of that, the testing strategy that we might have.""He told Olympics reporters Monday he thought the Covid-19 numbers were ""actually extremely low, they are probably lower than we were expecting to see of anything.""Competition begins Wednesday and the opening ceremony is scheduled for Friday. The Olympic Village is prepped with Covid-19 testing and health centers, with signs reminding residents to wear face masks and keep at least 1 meter (about 3.3 feet) away from each other. Athletes will be contact-traced and tested for Covid-19 daily; if they test positive, they are taken to an isolation facility outside the Olympic Village and will not be able to compete.Covid-19 breakthrough infections are preventable, but it's going to take a big effort to stop themDr. Amy Compton Phillips, chief clinical officer of Providence Health System, said officials are doing the right thing.""They're doing what one does with a novel pathogen when you want to contain it, not mitigate the spread, not, you know, slow down the spread, but stop it in its tracks,"" she told CNN's Jim Sciutto.One thing that would help stymie the spread of the virus would be if all professional sports teams could persuade 100% of their eligible members to get vaccinated, Sifri said.Major League Baseball and the player's union agreed earlier this year to relax certain health and safety protocols for clubs that have a vaccination rate of 85% or greater. Game postponed after 6 New York Yankees have tested positive for Covid-19, team saysThe Yankees are one of 23 major league teams to have reached that threshold, a source with knowledge of the situation said. Before those protocols were modified, players were tested at least every other day. But Sifri said the Delta and other variants are an elephant in the room.""The new variants raise the question: Is that (85% threshold) still enough?"" he said.Teams need to tell unvaccinated members to social distance and wear face masks in the locker rooms, he said. They also need to try to understand why a team member is not vaccinated.And what about the fans? Should spectators still wear a mask to an event? Sifri said he'd probably not wear one given the current situation.""I'm comfortable enough knowing the efficacy of the vaccines and the biology of transmission with being outside without a mask,"" he said. But he added he would also factor in local data and trends in cases. What's happening where he lives in Virginia, for example, might be better than another state where the numbers are concerning, he said.

Now he is a two-time major winner.Read MoreAfterwards, Morikawa said he's not done winning majors yet. ""At 24 years old, it's so hard to look back at the two short years that I have been a pro and see what I've done because I want more. I enjoy these moments and I love it, and I want to teach myself to embrace it a little more, maybe spend a few extra days and sit back and drink out of this,"" he told the media. ""But I just want more. When you're in these moments and you truly love what you do, which I love playing golf and competing against these guys, these are the best moments ever because the nerves push you to just be a better person.""READ: Sun, sea and golf and the challenge of playing in gusty wind, unforgiving rough and blind shotsMorikawa celebrates with the Claret Jug on the 18th green after winning the Open.Looking assuredHeading into the final day of action, it was almost impossible to pick a winner between Oosthuizen, Morikawa and Spieth. Despite having a shot advantage, Oosthuizen has developed an unfortunate habit of failing at the last hurdle over recent years. And so it proved, with two bogeys on the front nine dropping the South African down the leaderboard. Morikawa pounced to take advantage, coming up with three straight birdies to close out the back nine that gave him a four-shot lead before moments later, a birdie from Spieth reduced the gap to three. It was never plane sailing for the American. If overnight leader Oosthuizen faded over the final 18 holes, three-time major winner Spieth looked back to his best as he made a run at the top of the leaderboard. The 27-year-old American's putter was red hot and his chipping clever as he recovered from some early set backs to put some pressure on Morikawa. Oosthuizen did produce one moment of magic, hitting the flag on the tough par-three 11th hole, just millimeters from a memorable hole-in-one. Meanwhile, reigning US Open champion Rahm was putting together his own push for the coveted Claret Jug. An eagle on the 7th hole and a run of four straight birdies on the back nine shot him up the leaderboard and had the 26-year-old Spaniard dreaming of a second successive major. But Morikawa was unfazed. Despite his youthfulness and relative lack of experience at majors -- he's only played in seven before this weekend -- Morikawa calmly saw off his rivals.Morikawa celebrates after a putt on the 14th green during his final round of the Open.He kept his driving accurate, his iron shots precise and his putting crisp as he dealt with every challenge the tricky Royal St George's course could offer. And under the blinding English sun as the UK experienced a mini-heatwave, Morikawa was able to tap home the historic putt on the 18th hole to be crowned the 149th Open champion. The American is the first player to win the Open on his debut since Ben Curtis in 2003 at Royal St. George's.Morikawa also became the second player to win the Open and the PGA Championship before the age of 25 -- the only other golfer to have achieved that feat is Tiger Woods.After sinking the winning putt, he said that even though he may have outwardly looked calm, his nerves were jangling. ""I'm glad I look calm because the nerves are definitely up there. But you channel these nerves into excitement and energy, and that puts you away from like a fear factor into this is something I want. ""Especially as those last nine holes were coming in. Jordan was making birdies; I think Rahm was pushing; Louis had a birdie on 11, an amazing birdie. You can't worry about the score. I had to worry about every shot. Can I execute every shot to the best of my ability? Some we did, some we didn't, and then you move on. We can't control what's going to happen, what has happened. So I really looked at that as just focus on every shot, how do I see what is the best shot possible, and try and do my best from there.""Morikawa plays a shot on the 10th hole from the rough during the final round of the Open.Close but not enoughFor Morikawa's rivals, it was a case of close, but no cigar. Oosthuizen, who won the Open in 2010, has now finished runner-up or tied second at six different majors. And this week, despite finishing atop the leaderboard for three quarters of the Open, he faded in the final round yet again. For one of the most liked players in golf, it was heartbreak yet again as the South African finished tied for third. As for Spieth, who was searching for his first major victory since 2017 after a long spell with some struggles, the American showed that he is a force to be reckoned with again. Spieth was magnificent in all aspects of his game, carving up the course as he put pressure on his compatriot Morikawa. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosSpieth reacts on the green of the 18th hole on day four of the Open.However, Spieth believes it was his putting that eventually let him down. ""My putting is not where I want to be at all. I say at all,"" he told the media afterwards. ""It's progressing the right direction, but it's not where it has been. ""And I know what needs to do to get there, and it's just very difficult to do. But it's rounds like today or this week, major championship rounds, where you have to obviously test not only your touch out here, but also a lot of knobs and breaking putts and trust lines. ""I just wasn't extremely sharp with the putter this week. I was sharper than I was at Augusta, and it's been a little bit kind of here and there this year. My bad weeks have been okay and my good weeks are really good, but I needed to put in a little bit of work trying to almost get a solid couple hundred to 500 putts in between yesterday's finish to today's round to think that I could go out and confidently go stroke enough to win.""It wasn't quite enough on Sunday as Morikawa was able to hold on to be crowned The Champion Golfer of the Year. As a result of the win, Morikawa moves to No. 1 in the FedExCup and No. 3 in the world rankings."

In a speech at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, west London, Kerry called for more ambitious emissions reduction pledges, saying that even if all countries delivered on their commitments to the Paris Agreement, global average temperatures would still rise by 2.5 or 3 degrees Celsius (4.5 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit), or even more.""We are forewarned -- everything the scientists have been telling us will happen for 30 years now, is happening -- but bigger and faster than predicted,"" he said.Making a comparison with World War II, Kerry called for the same show of unity that followed the six-year conflict and established a new world order. Scientists are worried by how fast the climate crisis has amplified extreme weather""That journey has always given me a bedrock confidence that we can solve humanity's biggest threats together.

In Germany, where more than 160 people have died in recent floods, Chancellor Angela Merkel gave the same message over the weekend -- that the world needs to speed up its response to climate change. Some scientists are also saying that recent extreme weather events indicate a faster impact of climate change than projected. Kerry calls on China to step upWhile using his speech to call for a unified global approach, Kerry added that, ""Mother Nature does not pick and choose which country's emissions are warming the planet,"" and called on nations to engage with China, the world's biggest polluter, to tackle the climate crisis collectively.  ""What matters is our collective fate,"" Kerry said. ""To those who say we should avoid engaging with China on climate change because of our differences, I say there is simply no way -- mathematical or ideological -- to solve the climate crisis without the full cooperation and leadership of a country today that leads the world with 28% of global emissions."" Biden to focus on Covid-19, infrastructure, climate and cybersecurity at Cabinet meetingPresident Xi Jinping vowed to make his country carbon neutral by 2060 last September. But Kerry cited data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) that suggests China's contribution to global emissions will derail the ambitions of the Paris climate agreement. ""If China sticks with its current plan and does not peak its emissions until 2030, then the entire rest of the world would have to go to zero -- zero! -- by 2040 or even 2035,"" Kerry said. ""It knocks at least a decade off the timeline for the rest of the world to decarbonize. And that, my friends, sets a goal that currently is impossible to achieve,"" he continued. Kerry added that China's ""unprecedented economic growth"" had been underpinned by a ""staggering"" amount of fossil fuel use and Beijing could help spearhead endeavors to reduce global emissions. ""And as a large country, an economic leader, and now the largest driver of climate change, China absolutely can help lead the world to success by peaking and starting to reduce emissions early during this critical decade of 2020 to 2030.""Kerry also acknowledged that the world didn't need any new investment in oil, coal or gas production to meet energy needs, and called out countries opening up new coal mines. The UK is one country that has such plans.""By 2040, we should have entirely phased out all unabated coal and oil power plants and sharply reduced reliance on unabated natural gas generation,"" he said. But Joe Biden's administration has also come under criticism for issuing a high number of permits for oil and gas drilling on public and tribal lands. The roadmapTo end his speech, Kerry laid out a global to-do list, based on scientific advice, including cutting global emissions by at least 45% by 2030, to put the world on a path to net zero by the mid-century. ""That makes this a decisive decade. And it makes 2021 a decisive year,"" he said.Net zero refers to a state where the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere is no greater than the amount removed by natural carbon sinks, like forests, or technology that removes carbon from the source or atmosphere, known as carbon capture.  By 2030, the world must speed up its use of clean technologies, Kerry said, and pointed to IEA assessments to put in perspective what exactly is required to meet net zero: building the equivalent of the world's biggest solar plant every day for the next decade; quadrupling that use of wind and solar every year to 2030; and ensuring 60% of new car sales in 2030 are electric vehicles, among other measures.Green energy must be scaled up rapidly for heavy industry, shipping and aviation in particular. ""A raft of other technologies -- spanning advanced renewables and nuclear, long-duration energy storage, smart grids, and direct air capture -- will all need to be commercialized and scaled. This is even more of a challenge,"" he said.Kerry will travel to Rome on Wednesday and will return to London on Friday for a ministerial meeting over the weekend in the lead-up to COP26, which is starting on October 31."

Even he admits it could lead to more deaths from Covid - CNN",Boris Johnson is taking another huge gamble by lifting lockdowns in England. Even he admits it could lead to more deaths from Covid,"London (CNN)On Monday, Boris Johnson placed English citizens at the center of an experiment that will give some indication of how well a highly populated country with surging cases of Covid-19  copes when lockdown restrictions are lifted. In Johnson's favor, most of the UK's adult population is now double vaccinated. However, while those vaccinations have cut the numbers of people suffering from severe illness and succumbing to the disease after more than 128,000 deaths, the number of cases is rising. There is also scant evidence that vaccines prevent the worst effects of long Covid in those who become infected. Despite Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland -- the other, less populous, nations of the UK -- also being highly vaccinated, it is only England that is taking this leap on Monday. Almost all of the remaining coronavirus-related restrictions in England had been lifted as of Monday. Mandatory mask-wearing is gone, limits on the numbers of people who can mix indoor or outdoor have been ended, social distancing will be limited to people who have tested positive for the virus and airports, and venues like nightclubs and sports stadiums are free to open at full capacity. As midnight struck on Monday, thousands across England flocked to nightclubs for the first time since they closed back in March 2020. As it's no longer a legal requirement to prove one's Covid-19 status before entering such venues, the nation now waits to learn whether the end of restrictions will plunges the nation into an unprecedented wave of infection. Two people hug at the Egg nightclub in London early Monday. People hit the dance floor at The Piano Works in London early Monday. Read MoreIf someone is pinged by the NHS coronavirus track-and-trace app, they will still need to self-isolate until August 16, at which point double-vaccinated people will be free to carry on as normal. As cases continue to rise rapidly in England, the number of people told by the app to self-isolate is ballooning. In the week to July 7, 520,000 people received the alert, sparking worries about the program's impact on the economy. Even Johnson himself wasn't spared by the track-and-trace scheme. The Prime Minister and Chancellor Rishi Sunak were alerted after coming into contact with the Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who tested positive for the coronavirus on Saturday.Downing Street initially announced that instead of self-isolating, the two would take part in a ""daily contact-testing pilot,"" a scheme that is unavailable to the general public. However, just hours later and following public outrage, officials made a U-turn on the decision and said the two would self-isolate after all.Boris Johnson insists that the success of the vaccine rollout means restrictions can be lifted despite rising cases.It's not the first gamble the PM has taken during the pandemic: He ended a lockdown on December 2 having pledged people a normal Christmas, a promise he would ultimately break when he was forced to reimpose restrictions. During the summer of 2020, the government actively encouraged a completely unvaccinated public to get back into pubs and restaurants, going so far as offering financial incentives to do so. And he opted to go it alone and not join European partners in procuring vaccines, a decision that initially looked set to pay off as the UK raced ahead of its neighbors in jabbing people. Johnson has defended his latest decision on the grounds that the increase in cases was ""predicted."" Where in the past such data would lead a government to ""normally be locking down further,"" he said earlier this month, the ""continuing effectiveness of the vaccine roll-out"" means he is confident English people can be given their long-awaited ""freedom day"" on July 19. Johnson admitted that this would mean reconciling ""ourselves sadly to more deaths from Covid."" But, he added, ""if we can't reopen our society in the next few weeks, when we will be helped by the arrival of summer and by the school holidays, then we must ask ourselves when will we be able to return to normal?"" What could possibly go wrong?The main beneficiary of restrictions easing will be without question the hospitality industry, a major sector in the British economy. While most hospitality venues are chomping at the bit to return to work and making money, the dropping of restrictions isn't without complications. Kate Nicholls, chief executive at UK Hospitality, explained that many venues will impose restrictions on themselves in order to avoid the practical problems caused by the virus. She explained that ""pings on the (NHS coronavirus) app and then self-isolation"" required as a result is the biggest challenge many of these businesses will face, as it will exacerbate ""some of the existing labor shortages that are present in the market."" Some venues will only open for certain days of the week or hours in the day, which will ""have an impact on their ability to recover,"" Nicholls added. Frustrating, given that now is the ""first time in 17 to 18 months they'll be able to break even."" Further to that, these sorts of businesses will need to assure customers that their venues are safe by keeping measures like screens between tables, maintaining social distancing and possibly sticking to table service, which affects profits. The Prime Minister has acknowledged that the lifting of restrictions will mean further deaths.Inevitably, the return to something resembling normal in hospitality will lead to a greater surge in cases, which naturally carries its own risks.""Unfortunately, the hospitality industry relies on people interacting and meeting and that is going to drive up infection rates,"" says Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading. The consequences of a surge in the virus are where things could get sticky. Modeling by Imperial College London predicts that lifting all restrictions could lead to ""a significant third wave of hospitalizations and deaths."" While the existing covid vaccines are very effective, they are not 100%. Some people may get ill despite being fully vaccinated.Clarke explains that ""filling hospitals with people who are ill enough to be in hospital but not ill enough to end up in intensive care"" will put a huge strain on the NHS. And, he grimly adds, ""that looks like what's going to happen."" Any additional strain on the NHS will be unwelcome news to the millions of people who are awaiting treatment for non-Covid illness. The waiting list is currently at a record high. Potentially more damaging, Clarke says is that ""with every single infection of every single person, the likelihood of a mutation increases."" While he doesn't think that means we will immediately see a variant that is completely resistant to vaccines, he believes ""what we'll see is a progressive blunting of its effectiveness.""There is also limited data available on whether the vaccines offer protection against long Covid. The Office for National Statistics says about 1 million people are currently suffering from the condition in the UK. Many have been experiencing symptoms like fatigue and brain fog for months.A vaccine-resistant variant would blow a huge hole in Johnson's greatest success story of the whole pandemic: a speedy rollout of the magic bullet that stops the disease. The UK has also experienced a huge mental health crisis during the pandemic. Yet, rather than those issues disappearing as a result of restrictions lifting, there is a chance that it could drive further divisions between the public and cause more anxiety and trauma for people who might already be vulnerable. ""Some people will carry on, will continue to wear masks and to distance and they might perceive others as selfish for not doing so; those who don't do so might see others as overanxious,"" says John Drury, professor of social psychology at the University of Sussex. ""Solidarity is good for us, social support is good for us and those around us. It will be a source of distress for a lot of people to have that level of conflict,"" he adds. The UK was forced to return to lockdown in early January, following an easing of restrictions over Christmas.If this goes badly, there is a real chance it could backfire for Johnson. ""The public has consistently erred on the side of caution and the rules that the government has introduced are often viewed as not going far enough and being introduced too late,"" says Joe Twyman, director of public opinion consultancy Deltapoll.He believes that if a surge in cases and forced self-isolation leads to families canceling holidays and their summers being ruined, it could harm Johnson's popularity. ""If the situation gets worse, it may damage the government's position, because perception of how the government is dealing with the pandemic is correlated so closely to their support."" The worst-case scenario for Johnson might be, Twyman says, if things ""go south,"" facing whether to ""front it out or put in new measures."" The latter could be a catastrophic U-turn for Johnson, who said that his plan to take his nation out of lockdown was ""cautious but irreversible."" Johnson's pandemic has been a real mixed bag. Presiding over one of the developed world's highest death rates, a complete meltdown in testing, and complicated and confusing public messaging, he has been rescued only by a speedy vaccine rollout. Now is the moment he finds out if his great vaccine victory really was the saving grace it appeared not so long ago. If it's not, he has to make a very difficult choice: stick to his line of accepting his own people dying, or reverse on a stone cold promise to a nation that has become divided and disillusioned. And should that happen, he might wonder whether taking this gamble when the pandemic is far from over was that good an idea after all."

Our call to the IOC is simple: This can't be the intention of the rules, so it's about time to change the rules.""  The letter also criticizes the international sports community beyond the ban on the Soul Cap, adding that the ""stigmatisation of Black women and their bodies is not a new phenomenon.""

","sport, Mark Spitz: Seven ways to survive the Olympic Games - CNN",Mark Spitz: Seven ways to survive the Olympic Games,"(CNN)A nine-time gold medalist, Mark Spitz knows a thing or two about how to successfully navigate the Olympic Games as an athlete. Spitz, now 71, held the record of seven gold medals in a single Games when he dominated the pool in Munich in 1972, a tally that was surpassed by Michael Phelps in 2008. That was after Spitz had backed himself to win six golds in Mexico City in 1968, only to win two, both in relays -- a disappointment that he says motivated him to achieve his record-breaking feat four years later. Here, the former swimmer from the United States outlines the lessons he learned over the course of his Olympic career.Spitz (center) celebrates relay gold at the 1972 Munich Olympics.1. Be prepared, be motivated, and be lucky Read MoreA lot of people going to the Olympic Games have trained their whole life to do so. I once calculated that over the 13 or 14 years of my career leading up to Munich, I had swum around 26,000 miles -- enough to go around the equator, the whole of this planet.But then, so did another 200,000 athletes who were swimmers at the time. So, what singled me out? Maybe it was a little bit of luck. Maybe it was the program that I was in. Maybe it was my ""failure"" in 1968 that motivated me to do better. Australia's Michael Wenden swims to victory in the 100m freestyle at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. Spitz, in lane seven, finished third. 2. Life in the Olympic villageI think the village is fantastic, but a lot of the big athletes don't even stay there. After they compete, maybe they'll show back up at the village -- once they've secured the gold medal. JUST WATCHEDSee where Olympians will eat, sleep and relax in TokyoReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSee where Olympians will eat, sleep and relax in Tokyo 02:153. Beware of distractionsThere's a great atmosphere in the village, good for building friendships. But you're all there to do a job. Sometimes I felt that the village wasn't for me, it could be very distracting. It certainly was in 1968, when the swimming events were held in the second week. I was young and I lost part of my focus, I got involved in trading pins and doing all the other stuff. It's different now, though. Athletes are trained to stay sharp, regardless of when their competition is. Spitz competes in the butterly at the  1972 Summer Olympics.4. If at first you don't succeed ... I often think of Doug Russell in 1968. He swam slower than my world record in the 100m butterfly but still won the gold; I only got silver. But his win meant that he got to swim in the medley relay, not me. So, my silver potentially cost me two golds. In my final event, the 200m butterfly, I could have gone two seconds slower than my personal best and won the gold, but I was eight seconds slower and I finished dead last. The 200 'fly turned out to be my first race in Munich and I made sure that wasn't ever going to happen again. They called me a failure and that got to me. So, a bad experience can inspire somebody to become very successful. Spitz competes at the 1982 World Swimming Championships.5. A little misdirection doesn't hurt ...My Russian rivals at Munich had never seen me swim in person and they were gracious enough to give me a lane during one of their practice sessions. I knew they were taking pictures of me, so I started doing some stupid stroke that had nothing to do with anything. They asked if I always swam like that and I said ""yeah."" Then they asked if my mustache slowed me down. I'd been planning to shave it off that night, but I found myself saying that it actually deflected the water away from my mouth and I could get my face a lot lower and my body more streamlined. It probably did slow me down by a few hundredths of a second, but I was winning by seconds -- so it didn't matter. Anyway, after that, I decided to keep the mustache and it ended up being an interesting trademark!Sptiz is presented with his 200m butterfly gold in Munich. 6. Be realisticRoughly 10,000 athletes go to the Summer Games, and there are about 250 events. If you include all the team sports, around 1,000 medals will be handed out. So that means that only 10% of the athletes competing are going to be ""successful.""For many, just getting to the Games is an achievement, but it's only really about 15% who are in the hunt for the hardware. There are going to be a lot of disappointments.   Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresINSERT VIDEO7. If you make it to the podium, make the most of the moment ...Take it all in because it will never happen again; at no other point in your life is somebody going to stick you on a podium like that and they're not going to play your national anthem. In later life, your success won't be measured in the same way, because there's always going to be somebody that made a better deal, a bigger deal, a bigger acquisition with more money. So, if you're lucky enough to be one of those people, it's only going to be for a moment and then everybody else moves on. You've got to learn to live with that."

Qatar says it will give recommendations to attendees and participants of the tournament on how they can reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions, including from travel, accommodation and food and beverage.Once the spectacle is over, Qatar says it will offset any emissions generated during the tournament through building two mega solar power plants over the following 10-15 years, and by proactively supporting sustainable and low-carbon events in Qatar and the regionThe reusability of the stadium's parts is a reflection of that effort.""Sustainability and legacy have always been at the forefront of Qatar's planning and preparations for the World Cup,' said Al Atwan.After the World Cup the site will be converted into a retail space and large public park.When coming up with the stadium's design, Al Atwan said movability was the main consideration for choosing shipping containers as the building blocks.Containers are designed to be transported, either by air or sea, but when joined together to form a whole, they transform into a sturdy structure.That ended up reducing the waste created on site during construction, says Al Atwan, adding that the Ras Abu Aboud Stadium has set a benchmark for sustainable and green mega-sporting event infrastructure.Unlike the other seven Qatar 2022 venues, Ras Abu Aboud's temporary nature meant that fewer building materials were required, keeping construction costs down and shortening the time needed to complete it.Construction on the 4.8 million square feet (450,000 square meters) site commenced in late 2017 and is scheduled for completion by the end of this year, according to organizers.Fans can travel to the stadium via Doha Metro's Gold Line.Cooling sea breezeWhen a fan steps outside Ras Abu Aboud, they're met by Doha's West Bay skyline. So when the sun goes down, a symphony of color -- exchanged between the shimmering skyscrapers on one side and the stadium on the other -- reflects off the shores and lights up the city.And that proximity to the water doesn't only offer attractive views.All of Qatar's World Cup stadiums are equipped with highly efficient cooling systems that maintain a comfortable atmosphere regardless of the hot temperatures outside. The stadium will host seven World Cup games.But Ras Abu Aboud doesn't need one because it gets a natural cool breeze from the sea nearby.""Post-2022, the redevelopment of the site could take many forms and its legacy plans are still being finalized. It could be redeveloped into a public green space or used for a mix of commercial and residential projects,"" said Al Atwan. ""It's prime location means it's suited to many projects and has an exciting future,"" he added.That future is not only physical, Al Atawan tells CNN. ""Mega-sporting events like the FIFA World Cup have the power to inspire, prompt innovation and push existing boundaries to achieve new levels of success."""

Despite dislocating his shoulder on stage three, Thomas rode on but dropped down the rankings.Wearing the yellow jersey, Pogaca rides in front of The Louvre Museum on Sunday, July 18.In the mountains, Pogacar was put under pressure by Jonas Vingegaard when the peloton climbed Mont Ventoux twice, but the Slovenian recovered to ensure he didn't sufferany time loss. The Slovenian then won two summit finishes in the Pyrenees.The UAE Team Emirates rider won by five minutes and 20 seconds over second-place Vingegaard of Denmark.It was a measure of Pogacar's dominance that he also clinching the polka dot and white jerseys as King of the Mountains and best young rider respectively.Read MoreLast year, Pogacar became the youngest winner of the famous three-week race since 1904 and the first Slovenian to wear the yellow jersey, cycling's most coveted prize.Tadej Pogacar's closest rival during the Tour was Team Jumbo Visma's Jonas Vingegaard of Denmark (R), who finished second.Pogacar eraPogacar announced himself to the world with his shock victory in last year's Tour de France.In the year since, he has become a bona fide sporting superstar and his second consecutive Tour victory caps what has been one of the most meteoric rises, of any athlete, in recent memory.Still just 22 years of age, Pogacar looks set to be a dominant force in cycling's Grand Tours for many years to come, but the Slovenian has scoffed at the idea that this was the start of a 'Pogacar era.'""I don't consider this the 'Pogacar era,'"" the Slovenian cyclist told reporters after clinching another commanding victory on stage 18. ""That's just stupid in my opinion, but for sure a new era is coming.""We see so many youngsters stepping up to the highest level and we will see a lot of battles between everybody, so many young names. The next few years will be really tough.""However, former Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas, while admitting that Pogacar is ""a talented guy"", told ITV4 that ""nobody is unbeatable.""Pogacar autographs the polka dot jersey.Many of those battling it out at the highest level are Pogacar's fellow Slovenians.Roglic, 31, has already established himself as one of the best riders of his generation with two general classification wins in the Vuelta a España, while Matej Mohoric, just 26, is already a two-time Slovenian road race champion and boasts at least one individual stage win on each of cycling's three Grand Tours, clinching his section Tour stage win on Friday.Urska Zigart, Pogacar's girlfriend, claimed the first professional win of her career at just 24 years of age earlier this season to add to the country's burgeoning cycling reputation.It is a remarkable achievement for the young nation of just two million people, which has already started to dethrone cycling's more established powers. France, which hasn't had a Tour winner since Bernard Hinault in 1985, has a population of more 67 million people.Pogacar's ascent to Tour de France glory perhaps wouldn't have come as a surprise, the only surprise was that it happened so quickly.Just three years ago, Pogacar won the prestigious Tour l'Avenir, a race for Under-23 riders that follows the conclusion the Tour de France and often some of the same route.Pogacar rides ahead of Vingegaard during the 18th stage between Pau and Luz Ardiden, on July 15, 2021.If Pogacar's victory was one for the ages, this year's Tour wasn't always plain sailing, however, after a woman held out a banner and caused the crash of dozens of cyclists during the first stage.According to the race's video coverage of Saturday's incident, the sign hit German rider Tony Martin who was cycling near the head of the pack. Martin fell, which led to the subsequent crash of dozens of riders behind him.Cyclists fell en masse and the crash left bikes and bodies tangled in the road. The fall held the race up for several minutes.The woman who allegedly held out a banner was identified and underwent police questioning, the Brest prosecutor's office told CNN."

The village cemetery was swept away, headstones damaged and toppled by the force of the muddy water.Antoinnette Steinhoff stands at the edge of the flooded graveyard, crushed by the sight of destruction in front of her. ""My mother is over there,"" she says, pointing at a black marble grave with a cross on top.When the flooding hit the village, the 76-year-old saw an entire house dragged away by the water. Two people were still inside, Steinhoff said ""They found one of the bodies up in the vineyard,"" she added. Much of Altenahr lies in ruin now. Restaurants dotted around the river banks have been destroyed and entire chunks of buildings torn away. In some areas, the water mark reaches halfway through the second floor.  The streets, or what remains of them, are buried under mud, cars wedged between collapsed buildings and piles of debris.Read MoreIt's a sight seen across large swaths of western Europe following the catastrophic flooding that killed at least 160 people and left hundreds more missing or unaccounted for.Antoinnette Steinhoff stands at the edge of the flooded graveyard in Altenahr.At least 133 people died in Germany when the floods swept across the western states of North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland. In Belgium, 27 were confirmed dead as of Saturday afternoon, with authorities warning the number could go up.Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said ""my heart sank"" visiting Belgian towns, and she vowed to ""stand by"" flood victims whose homes have been destroyed. Drinking water supplies were gradually being restored in Wallonia.Luxembourg and the Netherlands have also been affected by the extreme rainfall, but have not reported any fatalities. Images showed entire towns and villages underwater and homes buried under landslides and debris. The desperate search for survivors continues despite rising waters, landslides and power outages. The German army deployed 850 soldiers for disaster relief.According to the Interior Ministry, around 22,000 firefighters and aid workers are taking part in the rescue and recovery operations in North Rhine-Westphalia alone.Residents described the chaos that ensued when the water rose, making it impossible to escape the area and trapping people in their homes. ""The water was so high that you couldn't go with smaller cars, they had special cars, and went in and tried to get (as) many people as possible out of that area. The whole night helicopters were coming and even tried to pull out people there,"" Michael Kautsch told CNN. Kautsch lives in Erftstadt, a town near Cologne that has become one of the symbols of the destruction. A number of buildings, including parts of a historic castle, were destroyed after a large sinkhole opened in a nearby quarry. ""The water was flowing and pulled parts of the town into that hole, and now ... the fire department says that there could be so much water under the buildings that a lot of buildings still can be damaged and can crash together,"" Kautsch said.European officials say 'climate change has arrived' as deadly floods engulf entire townsCommunication lines remain disrupted across the flooded areas, leaving people unable to reach loved ones. Police in Koblenz told CNN on Saturday that while as many as 1,300 people were still unaccounted for, authorities were hoping the numbers would be revised down as the rescue operation continues.""There is no end in sight just yet,"" Ulrich Sopart, a police spokesman in the city, told CNN. ''Our hopes are that some people might have been registered as missing twice or even three times -- if for example a family member, a work colleague or a friend has registered a person as missing,"" Sopart said.''Also, (in) some places phone lines are still down and reception is difficult. We do hope that people will get in touch with a relative, work colleague or friend to let them know they are fine,"" he said.Villages along the river Ahr have been left without power and phone coverage, with some areas completely cut off, forcing the military and search and rescue helicopters to survey the area from the air, searching for stranded survivors.German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier visited the Rhein-Erft-Kreis district of North Rhine-Westphalia state on Saturday. Seeing the destruction firsthand, he said clearing and recovery ""will take a long time.""The cemetery in Altenahr was flooded on Thursday.A dam along the river Rur in North Rhine-Westphalia broke Friday night, according to the regional government. Officials have started the evacuation of about 700 residents in the Ophoven neighborhood in the city of Wassenberg. Across the border in Belgium, the Belgian army is racing against the time with search and rescue operations.  Marie-Louise Grosjean, a shop owner in Pepinster, Belgium, saw a decade of hard work swept away by water and mud on Friday, when the water entered her wine and decorations store. She said her father has lived in the town for 70 years and has never seen anything like that. Grosjean's son Arthur told CNN the flooding came very quickly, leaving only destruction behind.""Thankfully I don't live there but it's my mother's business and there is nothing here. We hope we can quickly repair but we don't know how,"" he said, as he was helping the clear-up. ""The situation is changing by the minute, and remains extremely critical in many places,"" Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said at a news conference on Friday. ""The victims are the priority, rescuing is the priority, and care. All possible means are mobilized,"" he added, announcing that Belgium will hold a national day of mourning for flood victims on Tuesday. Meanwhile in the Netherlands, Dutch officials ordered the evacuation of 10,000 people in the municipality of Venlo, where the Maas river rose faster than expected. The high waters are expected to last until Sunday evening. Officials fear more dams could break and are closely monitoring reservoirs in the region. On Friday, a hospital in the region with 200 patients was evacuated.The Netherlands Red Cross is supporting flood evacuees as Venlo water levels rise.

Cologne, in North Rhine-Westphalia, recorded 154 millimeters (6 inches) of rainfall in the 24 hours to Thursday morning, which is nearly double its monthly average for July of 87 millimeters. In the Ahrweiler district, 207 millimeters (8.1 inches) of rain fell in only nine hours, according to the European Severe Weather Database.The downpours resulted in extreme flash flooding, with water levels rising within minutes.While it's too early for scientists to say how big a role climate change has played in causing this particular flooding, extreme rain events like the ones seen in western Europe this week are becoming more common and more severe. The premier of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, Armin Laschet, who is also the Conservatives' candidate to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel in the upcoming federal election, said the floods in his state were ""a catastrophe of historic proportion,"" calling on the world to speed up its efforts to both mitigate and adapt to climate change.Merkel plans to visit the region Sunday. Leaders have pledged recovery money to those affected.""The floods have literally pulled the rug from under people's feet,"" Laschet said.""We will be faced with such events over and over, and that means we need to speed up climate protection measures, on European, federal and global levels, because climate change isn't confined to one state,"" he said.While the overall amount of rainfall may not change over the course of the year in any given location, more of the rain is expected to fall in shorter bursts, which would tend to increase the frequency of flooding events.A damaged castle, left, is seen in Erftstadt-Blessem, Germany, Saturday, July 17, 2021. This was noted by scientists with the European Environmental Agency, who said that ""the projected increase in frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation over large parts of Europe may increase the probability of flash floods, which pose the highest risk of fatality.""Droughts, which are also becoming more common because of the climate crisis, can make flash flooding worse because very dry soil cannot efficiently absorb water. In 2016, flooding in Western Europe that killed 18 in Germany, France, Romania and Belgium was analyzed by scientists to see whether climate change played a role. They found that a warmer climate made the flooding 80-90% more likely to occur than it was in the past before man-made climate change.CNN's Sam Kiley, Barbara Wojazer, Melissa Bell, Chris Burns, Joseph Ataman, Nadine Schmidt, Schams Elwazer, Sharon Braithwaite, Angela Dewan, Ulrike Dehmel and Brandon Miller contributed to this report.

Read MoreOther golfers are less convinced by the delights of playing golf by the sea.""It's not my favorite venue that we've played. There are quite a few blind tee shots, hitting to nothing, fairways that are quite undulating,"" said four-time major winner Brooks Koepka in his pre-tournament press conference.Koepka plays his second shot on the 1st hole.Links golf is a harsh, unique style of course which can punish you for the slightest mistake, but a bit like that ice cream by the sea, when you game comes together and you get things right, life just seems to taste that little bit sweeter. Often built on sand dunes, links courses tend to have little vegetation except tall, thick grass which makes up an unforgiving rough for players.Between the long, dense rough and the strong sea wind, the most minute mistake can lead to calamity, with countless players' tournament hopes coming to a crashing end over the years.PGA Championship winner Phil Mickelson thought he ""was playing well coming into"" this year's Open having only recently become golf's oldest ever major winner.Mickelson plays a shot from the rough on the 12th hole at Royal St George's.However, in Thursday's opening round, the 50-year-old Mickelson finished in joint last place of the 156-man field after shooting a 10-over-par 80.Despite carding arespectable two-over par score on Friday, Mickelson struggled consistently with his driving, constantly having to play out of the thick rough. He missed the cut on Friday and was therefore ruled out of playing the Open's last two rounds.The six-time major winner admitted after his round on Friday that he was having some ""challenges staying sharp.""The ""bomb and gauge"" technique adapted by fellow American, Bryson DeChambeau -- one which has brought him his maiden major victory and shot him up the golf rankings -- was also challenged by Royal St George's.The 26-year-old DeChambeau admitted his driver ""sucked"" on Thursday and his waywardness with the club meant he only made the cut by the skin of his teeth, and his struggles continued on Saturday.READ: From 'biggest setback' to 'biggest breakthrough': How Jon Rahm became a major winnerLouis Oosthuizen plays an approach shot on the 16th hole during day two of The Open at Royal St George's.AdaptingThe Open's leaders after the first two rounds -- Oosthuizen, Morikawa and Spieth -- have used their skills with their irons rather than relying on their drivers and it has paid dividends.All three players have made over 77% of the greens over the first 36-holes of the tournament as they mitigated the dangers and traps of the links course.With an Open already to his name, Spieth looks looks like a kid excitedly queuing for an ice cream as he showcases some different skills here in the UK than he might on the PGA Tour.""It brings a lot of the feel aspect into the game,"" he told the media after his first round. ""I shorten swings up over here, and hit more punch shots, and stuff that I probably should be doing at home. You get less swing-focused and more shot-focused over here because the second you take your brain off the shot you're hitting, you may not find your ball.""Instead of just a driving-range shot in Palm Springs, there's always some shot you have to play that gives you a little bit of an advantage.

Officials have started the evacuation of about 700 residents in the Ophoven neighborhood in the city of Wassenberg. Dutch officials ordered the evacuation of 10,000 people in the municipality of Venlo, where the Maas river rose faster than expected. The high waters are expected to last until Sunday evening. Officials fear more dams can break and are closely monitoring reservoirs in the region.Barring any more severe weather, people who evacuated the flooding in the county of Euskirchen in North Rhine-Westphalia can most likely return to their home sometime on Sunday, the county said on its Facebook page.  This comes as water is being drained from the Steinbach dam to reduce pressure. Officials said creeks are filling, but are not expected to overflow their banks.   Officials had been monitoring the dam by drone earlier in the day and found no significant damage.  A clogged pipe has also been opened up to help with the water release.  Germany has deployed 850 troops to assist with disaster relief, the Bundeswehr (Germany armed forces) said Friday in a tweet.""Together with civilian helpers, the technical relief organization, fire brigades, we are pooling all available forces,"" Bundeswehr officials said.Federal Minister of Defence Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said she had spoken with her French counterpart Florence Parly who also offered military help.Germany's President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will visit the Rhein-Erft district of North Rhine-Westphalia state on Saturday, his office announced.

In Reifferscheid, in the Ahrweiler district, an incredible 207 millimeters (8.1 inches) of rain fell in only nine hours, according to the European Severe Weather Database.The intense deluges were the result of a slow-moving area of low pressure, which allowed a conveyor belt of warm and moist air to fuel powerful thunderstorms and heavy, long-lasting rain, according to the German weather service.Flood damage in North Rhine Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate is severely affecting train travel, according to Germany's rail service Deutsche Bahn, which is warning people to avoid the regions over the weekend.

FINA drew heavy criticism after Soul Cap, a UK-based brand, announced that the governing body for aquatic sports refused to approve the caps designed for swimmers with ""thick, curly, and voluminous hair"" in international competitions. The reason given was that their caps do not ""follow the natural form of the head,"" Soul Cap told the BBC. On Friday, FINA acknowledged the widespread condemnation and said it understood ""the importance of inclusivity and representation.""The statement posted to its official site read: ""FINA is committed to ensuring that all aquatics athletes have access to appropriate swimwear for competition where this swimwear does not confer a competitive advantage.""Biden on Sha'Carri Richardson's suspension for positive drug test: 'The rules are the rules'""FINA is currently reviewing the situation with regards to 'Soul Cap' and similar products, understanding the importance of inclusivity and representation,"" it continued.Read MoreThe governing body pointed out that there is currently ""no restriction"" on the use of Soul Cap swim caps for recreational and teaching purposes.Soul Cap founders Michael Chapman and Toks Ahmed Salawudeen had said their headwear plays a vital role in promoting racial diversity in competitive swimming and FINA's rejection would discourage younger athletes from pursuing the sport.Recent figures from Swim England show that 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children in England do not swim. ""For younger swimmers, feeling included and seeing yourself in a sport at a young age is crucial,"" they said in a statement shared on the official Soul Cap Instagram page. ""FINA's recent dismissal could discourage many younger athletes from pursuing the sport as they progress through local, county and national competitive swimming.""

FINA said it ""appreciates the efforts of 'Soul Cap' and other suppliers to ensure everyone has the chance to enjoy the water"" and intends to ""speak with the manufacturer of the 'Soul Cap' about utilizing their products through the FINA Development Centers.""

""We always wanted to be here and now that we have a very competitive package, we are just very happy that it's happening and now we just have to keep it up. Read More""I mean, it's still a very long season, we're not even halfway. Of course the gap at the moment looks nice, probably on paper, but also it's very easily gone. So we just have to make sure that we don't make mistakes and stay on top of it.""I never really look at these things. At the end of the day, they don't really make a big difference in terms of how I feel about it.""READ: Max Verstappen cruises to third successive GP victory at Austrian Grand PrixMax Verstappen celebrates his win at the Austrian Grand Prix.Still only 23 years of age, it's a testament to Verstappen's mental strength that he has been able to win each of the last three races after his mishap at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, which saw him spin out down the main straight due to tire failure just five laps from the end.It was a quite brilliant drive at the Monaco Grand Prix back in May that saw Verstappen take the lead in the drivers' championship for the first time and his performances have only improved since, allowing him to open up a 32-point gap over Hamilton.But as Azerbaijan has no doubt taught him, all that hard work could come undone in an instant.""I'm not enjoying it at the moment to be honest, not more than what I would be doing the last few years,"" Verstappen says. ""Because I know that it doesn't say anything at the moment. ""I want to be there at the last race and finish it off in that way, because of course you can be happy right now, but then if you lose out at the end of the year, then there's nothing to be happy about. ""So that's why I'm quite neutral in everything and I'm just very focused on what I have to do.""Nobody has ever doubted Verstappen's championship-winning credentials as a driver, so far in his six-year career the common consensus has been that it's the Red Bull car that has let him down.This season, however, that looks to have changed.'I start to think about all the bad scenarios that can happen': Charles Leclerc on why he is so protective of his brotherRed Bull, headed up by team principal Christian Horner, has made dramatic improvement's on last year's car and have finally provided Verstappen with a vehicle capable of challenging Hamilton and Mercedes.Verstappen believes the team's dominance at tracks they haven't generally performed well at in the past -- France, for example, where the Dutch driver this season secured pole and the race win -- will stand them in good stead for the upcoming British Grand Prix, where Hamilton and Mercedes have dominated in recent years.""The team, including Christian, they focus on giving me that car, which they have given me this year and now we're just working really well together,"" says Verstappen. ""I think we really made a good step forward from last year and now it's all about keeping that up [and] improving, because we cannot just rely on what we have now until the end of the season. We just have to keep trying to be better.""You have to be positive as well, but we know that they [Mercedes] are going to be very strong there [Silverstone], they are bringing upgrades so it's not going to be easy. I'm confident that we can do a good job here as well.""This weekend's British GP will be the first of three races this season to feature a brand new qualifying format.The usual one-hour qualifying session will still feature, but it will only decide the starting positions for the sprint qualifying session, rather than the race itself.Max Verstappen kicks his tire after crashing out in Azerbaijan.It will be this new sprint qualifying session, a 100 kilometer, 17-lap race, that will decide how the drivers line up for Sunday's grand prix. Points that count towards to drivers' championship total will also be awarded to the top three drivers in sprint qualifying, with three for first place, two for second and one for third.""I'm actually quite open-minded,"" Verstappen says of the new format. ""I'm not against it, I'm not for it at the moment. I just want to see how it progresses. It's very new. ""For sure it will be a bit of an adjustment to be made in terms of how you approach the whole weekend. But I guess time will tell, we'll just find out how it goes. ""It's difficult to say right now [if it will impact the race]. After FP1 [first practice], you make your changes for qualifying and you can't really adjust the car anymore, so you hope that you make the right changes. ""So you will find out a little bit during the sprint race or qualifying race if it's good or not -- and if it's not good, then you're in trouble."""

The murmuring only increases as they realize that this hole will be one of the few that he uses his massive driver.A flurry of camera phones are switched to video mode as DeChambeau prepares to hit the ball on the 12th tee and a deathly quiet falls upon the masses, the atmosphere heightened by the sea breeze sweeping in from the English Channel.The ensuing powerful strike from DeChambeau's hulk-like figure sends reverberations of oohs and ahhs across the throng of onlookers.""How does your back survive that?"" one fan says in amazement. It's as if Dechambeau is golf's answer to Superman. Another fan says that while he can track other players' balls, DeChambeau's travels too fast for his eyes.Read MoreDeChambeau hits a tee shot during day one of The Open.DeChambeau's group at the 149th Open at Royal St George's -- alongside Jordan Spieth and Branden Grace -- was one of the most popular of the opening round, attracting a large following as the trio of golfers make their way around the famous course, which is based in the county of Kent, known as the""Garden of England.""The Open was canceled last year due to the coronavirus pandemic so it's understandable why the fans would be excited to see the world's best golfers compete in the UK.The 2020 US Open winner's entrance to the first tee was greeted by loud cheers, a few whistles and the odd shout of encouragement under the bright morning sunshine.Despite the ongoing spat he is having with compatriot Brooks Koepka, there was seemingly no instances of goading from the eager crowd during DeChambeau's round on Thursday.After almost two years without golf, the fans on the first tee would have been disappointed when the big-hitting American -- famous for his booming drives and use of science to hone his game -- opted for an iron on the opening hole, which he eventually bogeyed.Wherever DeChambeau roamed on the Kent course, fans followed in his footsteps -- as well as a constant chorus of: ""Come on Bryson"" -- some witnessing for the first time the golfer's sheer strength.However, the links course -- near the sea where the wind is often a big factor -- provided a stern test for DeChambeau, one which his powerful approach often couldn't overcome.He finished one-over par after his first round, seven shots behind the clubhouse leader, Louis Oosthuizen.DeChambeau plays his approach shot from the 18th fairway during his first round of The Open.A run of three straight birdies on the back nine had drawn him to one under, but two bogeys in the last four holes meant DeChambeau had to settle for a first round 71.Throughout the opening round, DeChambeau struggled with his big driver, hitting just four fairways from 14.""If I can hit it down the middle of the fairway, that's great, but with the driver right now, the driver sucks,"" the 27-year-old said after his round.""It's not a good face for me and we're still trying to figure out how to make it good on the mis-hits. I'm living on the razor's edge like I've told people for a long time.""It's quite finicky for me because it's a golf course that's pretty short, and so when I hit the driver and it doesn't go in the fairway, it's first cut or whatever, or it's in the hay, it's tough for me to get it out on to the green. Like once in the middle of the fairway like I had it on 18, I was able to hit a nice shot to 11 feet and almost made birdie.""Later DeChambeau issued an apology on Instagram saying: ""I sucked today, not my equipment.""""I deeply regret the words I used earlier,"" he wrote. ""I am relentless in pursuit of improvement and perfection. Part of that causes me to become outwardly frustrated at times. ... My game is a constant work in progress and so is controlling my emotions.""READ: Georgia Oboh: Nigeria's first Ladies European Tour playerDeChambeau lines up a shot during day one of The Open.'Progressing nicely'While DeChambeau struggled, his playing partner Spieth had a more serene time of of it.The three-time major winner hit six birdies and just one bogey on his way to a five-under par round and just one shot off clubhouse leader Oosthuizen.After a few lean years on the PGA Tour having burst onto the scene as a youngster, Spieth looks to have rediscovered his touch over recent months, finishing third at the Masters in April and claiming his first win in 1,351 days at the Valero Texas Open just before the Augusta tournament. ""To be honest, the path that I'm on and where I've been before in the game, I feel really good about my chances going forward, as good as they have been historically,"" Spieth told the media.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosSpieth reacts after making his birdie putt on the 15th green during his first round of The Open.""As far as surprised or not, I guess I feel like I've been trending the right way and certainly had a chance this year already at Augusta. Made some mistakes in the first round and second round that I shouldn't have made that I very well could have won that golf tournament this year. I like where I'm at.""Again, I feel like I was progressing nicely. Took a couple steps back really on the weekend at Colonial through the US Open, and I know what it was now and tried to put in some good work over the last few weeks to get back on the same and even forward it from where I was already progressing."""

Sign up here.  London (CNN)It's difficult to imagine the Duchess of Sussex would ever be asked for her résumé -- but if she were, it would be a lengthy read. 'Actress,' 'senior royal,' philanthropist,' 'broadcaster,' 'author'... and now, she can add 'executive producer' to her extraordinary list of roles. It's probably more useful to look at how Meghan defines herself, because that's where you'll find the through line. In an op-ed for the New York Times she wrote last year, she was styled ""a mother, feminist and advocate."" That speaks to the work she's focused on, as opposed to the role she's in. She and Prince Harry are now financially independent of the royal family, so they do still need to make money, but they are also on a bigger mission.For her debut as a producer, Meghan is joining forces with friend and filmmaker David Furnish to create an animated series for Netflix. What they lack in video streaming experience will be made up for by a team of established producers who will work alongside them.The project's working title is ""Pearl,"" and it focuses on ""a young girl's heroic adventure as she learns to step into her power and finds inspiration from influential women throughout history."" Read MoreThe message ties in with the children's book Meghan wrote, the interviews she's given and all the projects she spearheaded as a working royal. It's perhaps less about creating the content, and more about the impact it has. Meghan appears to be driven by a missionary purpose more than a creative impulse, and she's often stressed the importance of highlighting people who have felt unfairly disadvantaged.""Like many girls her age,"" Meghan says in a statement, ""our heroine Pearl is on a journey of self-discovery as she tries to overcome life's daily challenges."" The duchess adds that the show ""celebrates extraordinary women throughout history,"" and that she and Furnish have ""been eager to bring this special series to light.""Meghan's book ""The Bench"" was released last month.Many will look to which ""extraordinary women"" are included as an indication of who inspired Meghan. Others will ask where Meghan will go next in her career. There are myriad roles out there that would allow her to continue her work as ""a mother, feminist and advocate,"" and she's shown how she can pull in expertise and experience where needed. Her book ""The Bench"" was informed by her own experience as a child, when she discovered ""how it felt to not see yourself represented,"" she said in an interview with National Public Radio last month. ""So any child or any family hopefully can open this book and see themselves in it, whether that means glasses or freckled or a different body shape or a different ethnicity or religion,"" Meghan said of that project. Along with Harry, she's already working with Netflix on a docuseries about the Invictus Games. And she'll have further opportunities to expand her repertoire soon -- Netflix's co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, has previously said the couple are ""building an ambitious slate"" of programming that ""reflects the values and causes they hold dear.""Meghan's output so far gives a strong indication of where her efforts will lie -- but we still can't be sure what comes next. There's no doubt she'll be offered acting, speaking and producing roles, and if she emerges as a major draw on Netflix, her profile will only rise. But for now, Meghan is picking her next projects carefully. And after all, she's still on parental leave...WILLIAM CONDEMNS RACIST ABUSE OF ENGLAND'S FOOTBALLERSWilliam and Kate at Wembley during the Euro 2020 finalAs President of England's Football Association, the Duke of Cambridge was front and center during England's Euro 2020 final against Italy on Sunday. Tens of millions of British viewers saw him celebrate his country's early goal, nervously endure a tense extra-time period, and ultimately leave disappointed after Italy won a dramatic penalty shootout. But within hours of the final, William found himself intervening in an altogether more somber national conversation about racism. Three Black English players -- Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka -- were racially abused online after missing penalties in the shootout, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson was pressed to explain why he hadn't previously condemned fans who booed players while they took the knee before matches to show their opposition to racism.""I am sickened by the racist abuse aimed at England players after last night's match,"" the duke said in a message online on Monday morning, as outrage spread around the country at the reports of harassment on social media. ""It is totally unacceptable that players have to endure this abhorrent behaviour. It must stop now and all those involved should be held accountable.""It may not be the last time that William confronts the issue. The UK is expected to launch a bid to host the 2030 World Cup, and the duke will undoubtedly be a major ambassador for that push. But as a spotlight is shone on racism in football, William is in a delicate position -- having to sell the world on the idea that England is the natural home of the ""beautiful game,"" while simultaneously being forthright and unequivocal in condemning the ugliest corners of the sporting community.It won't be forgotten, either, that the royal family itself has faced allegations of racism by one of its own this year. After Meghan, Duchess of Sussex accused a senior member of the firm of enquiring about her baby's skin color, William told a reporter the Windsors are ""very much not a racist family,"" a statement many criticised.So, after a high-profile summer cheering on Britain's national sport, William will be in a closely watched role. He'll be expected to be involved in efforts to remove racism from football, and his words on the matter will carry weight. And with fans still dreaming of football ""coming home"" in nine years, he'll need to help clean up the reputation of the English game on the world stage, too.WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?Brits picnic at the palace.The pandemic forced Buckingham Palace to close its doors to the public, but with the sun returning to London, staff at the site have found a new way to welcome visitors. The palace gardens have been opened for picnics and self-guided tours for the first time ever, with free tickets being snapped up. The first visitors have been filing into the estate this week, and demand was so high that the gardens will remain open until September. It's more than just a scenic spot to enjoy lunch -- the palace's gardens include a sprawling lake, a wildflower meadow and two plane trees planted by and named after Queen Victoria and her husband, Prince Albert.Demand for tickets has been high.An environmental warning from Charles. The Prince of Wales gave a stern message to radio listeners this week, warning that a reliance on cheap, unsustainable farming could ""rip the heart out of the British countryside."" The lifelong environmentalist called for more focus on sustainable agriculture and was full of praise for figures including footballer Marcus Rashford, whose campaigning led to free school meals being provided to millions of underprivileged children. ""We must put nature back at the heart of the equation,"" Charles said in an essay on BBC Radio 4. It's a message he has trumpeted many times. Earlier this year, the prince launched a new climate push, urging firms to commit to practical action and set the world on a greener path.

Young and old, a huge crowd has assembled here at the opening hole at Royal St George's.The golfer they are trying to catch a glimpse of bounds into view with typical jauntiness and the crowd erupts in delight.Rory McIlroy may be going through a rough patch on the links course, but golf fans still absolutely adore him.After a typically booming drive he strides off the first tee at the Open with purpose and is greeted with a cacophony of: ""Come on, Rory,"" in particular from younger fans.Having burst onto the scene as a young golfer, winning four majors and capturing the hearts and minds of many golf fans -- in particular, those from the UK -- McIlroy is a name that is often sought on leaderboards, with many wishing him well whenever he steps onto the course.Read MoreREAD: 'Everybody loves to hate the villain,' says Shooter McGavin 25 years on from 'Happy Gilmore'McIlroy putts on the 6th green during his second round of The  Open.This year's Open is no different -- there are constant shouts of encouragement as he navigates the course at Royal St George's.On the opening hole, however, things don't quite go to plan for the Northern Irishman. He has to settle for a bogey -- cue loud groans from the assembled masses.Here lies the essence of being a fan of McIlroy, who last won a major in 2014, when he was victorious at the PGA Championship and the Open.Over 18 holes, you are likely to see some glaring errors and missed shots. But you will also see some fabulous strokes, which have you questioning why he can't do that more consistently.And this volatility is why as McIlory makes his way around the 18 holes, perhaps attracts such a devoted following, with crowds six or seven deep cramming round greens to cheer on the 32-year-old.On the second hole, Mcllroy has to settle for another bogey, with one disappointed fan exclaiming: ""That is unbelievable.""McIlroy tees off from the 1st hole during his second round of The Open.However on the par four fourth hole, McIlroy like a magician conjures up a birdie to claw a shot back. ""He is just brilliant,"" opines another McIlory fan.And so it goes. Brilliant shots interspersed with errant ones. Though there's one constant; fans' willingness to cheer McIlroy on come what may.Two birdies in the middle of his round are met with rapturous applause. When the Northern Irishman has a key putt, it's almost as if the fans are trying to suck the ball into the hole, while their phones are pointed in his direction to document the moment.A late pair of bogeys halts McIlroy's climb up the leaderboard -- although a vital birdie on the 18th helps cover up some of that damage -- as he finishes the second round on level par, nine shots behind the leader Collin Morikawa.McIlroy tees off on the 16th during his second round of The Open.But it's a birdie that ensures McIlroy will play on both Saturday and Sunday after making the cut, and will give thousands more fans the opportunity to see him and that familiar jaunty walk up and down the fairways. ""It's brilliant. It feels great,"" McIlroy told the media after his round. ""I think everyone has missed this tournament for the last couple years.""It's nice to have it back. I've had a great support out there the last couple days, and as I said, pleased at least to get in the clubhouse and make sure I get a bit more support over the next two days, as well.""No first time nervesMorikawa and debuting at majors seem to go hand in hand. The American won his maiden major last year at the PGA Championship, his first time competing in the event. This week, Morikawa is making his debut at the prestigious Open, and he's showing no sign of nerves. The 24-year-old put in a brilliant six-under 64 on Friday to move to 9-under for the tournament and move into a runaway clubhouse lead. And it could have been even better for him, after an uncharacteristic bogey on the 15th hole meant he just missed out on numerous course and competition records. He was just one shot shy of the course record, a shot off equaling the lowest 36-hole score in Open history.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosMorikawa is playing in only his second professional tournament on European soil after last week's Scottish Open. And with the experience he learned last week and his mentality in majors, he believes he's in a good position. ""We have four (majors) a year, and you're trying to definitely win these four because they're that big,"" he told the media. ""Talking about last year's PGA, I had played with every single guy, and that doesn't make anything different. It's just the stage that we're on, more media, more spectators, more people around. ""But that's everything outside that I could control.

""We talked about the challenges of climate change, and I'm very, very glad that the United States have returned to the Paris Accord, and that this gives us a very different basis in Glasgow to fight for more climate protection at the Conference of the Parties,"" she said. ""I think the meteorological events -- whether it's fires hitting the United States, dramatically high temperatures, or just sudden irregular rainfalls -- indicate that the number of extraordinarily weather events has increased dramatically in recent years. We need to respond to that.""An aerial view of the flooding in Erftstadt, in Germany's North Rhine-Westphalia state on Friday.Her comments echoed those of her environment minister, Svenja Schulze, who tweeted Thursday: ""Climate change has arrived in Germany.""The events show with what force the consequences of climate change can affect us all, and how important it is for us to adjust to extreme weather events in the future.""There is growing acknowledgement and acceptance now from many politicians that anthropogenic -- or human-induced -- climate change plays a role in extreme weather events.Biden, for example, recently linked the extreme heat and prolonged drought in the US to climate change.EU unveils ambitious climate package as it cools on fossil fuels Scientists are now able to estimate just how big a role climate change has played in a particular event. It's too soon to make conclusions about current flooding in Europe, but estimates are likely to be made in coming days.A similar, though less extreme, flooding event in Western Europe in 2016 that killed 18 people in Germany, France, Romania and Belgium, for example, was found to be 80-90% more likely to occur than it was in the past before anthropogenic climate change.While officials at the national and EU level are sounding the horn on climate, so too are local leaders on the disasters' front lines.The premier of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany -- Armin Laschet, who is also the Conservatives' candidate to succeed Merkel -- said the floods in his state were ""a catastrophe of historic proportion,"" calling on the world to speed up its efforts to both mitigate and adapt to climate change.""The floods have literally pulled the rug from under people's feet,"" Laschet said.""We will be faced with such events over and over, and that means we need to speed up climate protection measures, on European, federal and global levels, because climate change isn't confined to one state,"" he said.What's causing this heavy rainfall?As the Earth's atmosphere warms, it can hold more moisture, which in some cases leads to unprecedented rainfall. It may be that the total average rainfall in an area doesn't change, but extremes are amplified, which can mean longer dry periods or more intense storms.

Flash flooding occurs when rain falls faster than the ground can absorb it. It is ""flash"" because its onset is rapid -- water levels can rise meters in minutes. When there is more water vapor in a warmer atmosphere, rainfall rates can increase and flash flooding is more likely to occur.And drought can actually compound this effect. Very dry soil can't absorb water efficiently -- think of trying to wet a very dry sponge. While the rain is ultimately beneficial, if a region that has been experiencing intense drought gets hit with heavy rain, flash flooding is more likely to occur.That's the dynamic in Germany and Belgium at the moment. Just a few months ago, there were historically low water levels on the Rhine in Cologne, which were disrupting shipping along the river, but now the river has swelled from two months of rain falling in just one day.The projections for how much the Earth would warm have largely been correct, said Myles Allen, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford. But there have been outliers -- namely, the warming in Europe has been faster than predicted.Allen said scientists expected more extreme weather events, but records are being blown away at a concerning clip -- the unprecedented heat wave in the Northwest US in late June is another recent example.""Extreme events happen and records get broken all the time,"" Allen said, ""but it is worrying that we're seeing such rapid intensification.""With more action, he said, climate change could be addressed in a generation. Deadly flooding and heatwaves serve as a reminder of the climate crisis' reach. ""A problem is that every climate documentary starts with an image of a polar bear, which send the message that climate change happens in the Arctic, on the other side of the world,"" Allen said. ""But these events show that's not true.""CNN's Angela Dewan reported from London, Brandon Miller reported from Atlanta, Nadine Schmidt reported from Berlin and Ulrike Dehmel reported from Bonn."

Charles Leclerc first stepped into a kart when he was four years old, and was hooked by the thrill of speed after he had his first lesson with his godfather and French racing driver Jules Bianchi. But the financial support required for motorsport racing was an extra barrier, and as the years progressed, his family weren't able to afford the cost of competing. That's when manager Nicolas Todt stepped in, taking on Leclerc in 2012 and paying for his next season. As Leclerc made his way, Bianchi endured a fatal crash in 2014 at the Japanese GP, spent nine months in a coma, and passed away the following year. Tragically, Leclerc's father died in 2017, two experiences that the F1 star told the Guardian were ""incredibly hard,"" but made him ""stronger as a person and as a driver."" Charles Leclerc prepares to drive on the grid ahead of the Styria Grand Prix at Red Bull Ring on June 27, 2021 in Spielberg, Austria.A family affairRead MoreThese days, the 23-year-old driver has a watchful eye on younger brother Arthur Leclerc, an up-and-coming racer three years his junior, who recently joined the Ferrari Driver Academy and clinched his maiden F3 victory at Circuit Paul Ricard.""I'm just very, very happy to see him doing so, so well,"" Leclerc tells CNN Sport's Amanda Davies. ""I really hope that he will be joining me on the Formula One grid very soon, but it's still a long way to go.""Even though Leclerc celebrates his brother's success, his protective instincts trump his ability to fully embrace his pursuit of the sport.""I'm 10 times more stressed whenever it's him racing compared to when I am racing, because when I have the helmet on, I don't think about the danger of the sport,"" he says. ""But whenever I see him from the outside, I start to think about all the bad scenarios that can happen,"" he adds.Ultimately, the foundation of their relationship lies off the track. ""Whenever he needs help, he knows that I'm here for him and he can call me anytime [...] but most of the time, we are just speaking about our lives, just like normal brothers will do."" Charles Leclerc celebrates after his brother, Arthur Leclerc, won the F4 race before the F1 Grand Prix of Germany at Hockenheimring on July 28, 2019 in Hockenheim, Germany.Growing up in MonacoLeclerc was born and raised in Monte Carlo in Monaco, which is known for its cobbled streets, twinkling harbors and shiny white yachts.He's one of the 10,000 locals in the country, and comes from more humble beginnings than the majority of the population, many of whom are millionaires attracted to the French Riviera city state's tax status. The racing star isn't jaded by the opulence, instead presenting a sense of gratitude and humility. ""From outside, I don't think it gives the same image as the image I have of my own city.""""I have all my friends, all of my family, and there's not all these glamorous parts of it, this party side. Of course, there's also this side of Monaco, but I don't feel it when I'm there, it's more relaxing."" JUST WATCHEDCharles Leclerc enjoys streaming and gaming during lockdownReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCharles Leclerc enjoys streaming and gaming during lockdown 03:14For Leclerc, beneath the gilded veneer lies a rich history of fabled racers and spectacular circuits -- most notably, the Monaco Grand Prix.Known for its tight and twisty layout, the circuit has been a technically-challenging contest ever since it first appeared on the F1 calendar in 1950. Past victors include legends of the sport such as Ayrton Senna, Michael Schumacher and Graham Hill. Leclerc says his upbringing in Monaco was key to his F1 career because he learned the merit of working hard and respecting others. ""These two values are probably the most important.""""Monaco has given me most of the values that I try to share in Formula One. I'm just very, very proud and very happy to be born there.""Leclerc drives during qualifying for the Monaco Grand Prix on May 22, 2021 in Monte-Carlo.Learning from fellow athletesAs someone who wants to reach the peak of his sport, Leclerc says he admires fellow athletes who can show their ability to excel, including Juventus and Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo.  Ronaldo, who recently equaled the all-time international goalscoring record at Euro 2020, met Leclerc when he visited Ferrari's famous Maranello headquarters in May.""He gave us some tips [...] as an athlete. The way he prepares himself, et cetera, which was very, very interesting,"" Leclerc says. ""Then we had some fun driving some cars. But we didn't talk too much about work, it was more about having fun."" When asked if Ronaldo was unfazed during his ride, Leclerc laughs. ""Yeah, well, brave, I wouldn't go that far, but I am sure that he enjoyed it. I think he was quite impressed by how much those cars are going fast."" Nonetheless, he has a deep level of respect for the global icon. ""He's a legend of football, but not only (that). I think for every athlete, we are all very impressed by him [...] he's an amazing athlete."" Leclerc and Ferrari celebrates in Parc Ferme during qualifying ahead of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix  on June 05, 2021 in Baku, Azerbaijan.Fighting for the winLeclerc is cautiously optimistic about his prospects for the rest of the season, recognizing that Mercedes star Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen are the two competitors most in contention for topping the standings in 2021. ""I'm not frustrated, but I want to be back in the fight with the top guys like we were in 2019. So there's a lot of motivation for the whole team because we don't want Ferrari to be fighting for fifth or sixth place,"" he says.  ""But on the other hand, it's very good to finally see a fight between two teams for a world title. I think people are enjoying it."" He's not wrong. Fans and neutrals alike are relishing the battle between the teams, a dynamic Leclerc will no doubt see play out at the British Grand Prix in Silverstone. Taking place on Sunday, July 18, the race is scheduled to be held in front of a capacity crowd. Having been staged behind closed doors in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, Leclerc is looking forward to the return of spectators at the event. ""It's amazing to finally see life getting back to normal a little bit. It's been a long time and it's great to feel the passion of the fans,"" he says.""I don't know how much will be involved with the fans and how close we will be to them because of the bubble we are in. But we at least feel the support in the grandstand to see them while we are driving feels amazing.""Leclerc makes a pitstop during the Styrian Grand Prix.The future of FerrariFerrari recorded its worst season in 40 years in 2020 and the current campaign sees the team fourth in the constructors' championship. Leclerc is sixth in the drivers' championship on 60 points, with teammate Carlos Sainz Jr. on 62 points.""We are more or less the same age, we have the same interests, we play the same sports,"" he says. ""We are having good moments, but we are also working very well together with the team in hard moments [...] to try and come together.""Leclerc says Ferrari is focused on looking ahead to the 2022 season with the promise of a new car, while still ""trying to to work as hard as possible"" between races. Carlos Sainz and Leclerc  talk on the grid ahead of the Styrian Grand Prix at Red Bull Ring on June 27, 2021 in Spielberg, Austria.The 2022 season sees the introduction of new rules which will ""create radically different looking cars, capable of harder, closer racing,"" according to F1.""A lot of the guys at home are focusing on the 2022 car, which will be a huge opportunity for us, but which will be very, very important for the years after it, because it's a completely new car,"" Leclerc says. ""And so there's also part of the team that is still focusing on this year [...] so it's a fine balance.""It's small steps in the right direction, but it's going in the right direction, which is very, very important."""

Athlete ActivismIt's something Loyd and other WNBA players are no strangers to, dedicating their 2020 season to Breonna Taylor and the Say Her Name campaign.""Playing basketball with this platform, having her name on our jersey, it made it known it was bigger than us. It's bigger than basketball, someone's life was lost, was taken,"" says Loyd. With the league using their platform to shine light on issues like police brutality and voting rights, it was also educational for the players in another sense.  ""From an athlete's perspective, we have a voice. I think they're understanding the power that they have, that they're not just pick up the ball and dribble,"" says Loyd.""They're not just here to do my job and go home. People are accepting who they are, their access to things, and understanding that we can have an impact. And that's a beautiful thing, that we can change the curve or the way things are adapting and moving,"" says Loyd. Jewell Loyd of the Seattle Storm warms up with teammates before the game against the Las Vegas Aces on June 27, 2021 at  Michelob ULTRA Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.Loyd has been working on finding her voice and her lane since coming into the league in 2015, when she won Rookie of the Year.Early in her career, Loyd, who is dyslexic, starred in an ad campaign for the education non-profit Eye to Eye, raising awareness for those with dyslexia, ADHD, and other learning disabilities.""My passion is always to give back, to impact the next generation, and figuring out how to do that in my own way."" Uplifting the next generation of basketball playersDuring the early stages of lockdown in 2020, Loyd met with Lakers assistant coach and personal trainer Phil Handy, who asked to record and post a workout online -- telling her that people wanted to see what it was like to train as an elite athlete. After positive feedback, Handy and Loyd put together a session for their training app 94feetofgame, and using Loyd's nickname the ""Gold Mamba"" workout was born.""It was amazing, seeing the comments from parents and kids -- especially during the quarantine, when you couldn't really do anything, but you could go outside and pick up a ball and dribble."" Loyd got comments and video feedback from all over the world, and while appreciative of the virtual training space she had created, she was also looking for a physical space as well. ""I always wanted to have some kind of gym that allows kids to be themselves and have great mentors,"" says Loyd.So when brother Jarryd, a former college standout at Valparaiso, found out a childhood gym was up for sale, the two jumped at the opportunity to take ownership. ""I grew up playing in this gym, it's called the Warehouse and it's a special place for me because that's where I started to believe that I can be more than just a high school basketball player or a college basketball player."" Loyd, a two-time WNBA Champion, hopes she can inspire that feeling in others, though that isn't the only reason for the gym's existence: ""It's okay if they come there and don't become a Division One athlete, but if they become a better person ... that's a win for me.""WNBA Champion Jewell Loyd at The Warehouse outside of Chicago on Feb. 21, 2021. Loyd is looking to turn the gym into a place of ""acceptance and excellence."" The building, tucked away in the suburbs of Chicago and not far from the highway I-94, offers a space of her own for the next iteration of basketball players.Loyd, who already has courts named in her honor at Proesel Park in Lincolnwood, Illinois, wanted it to be a building that created a sense of belonging. ""All the things that I work with ... it's really based on community building, a community of safe spaces and empowering kids to believe in themselves and achieve their goals. People need people, and that's what it's all about."""

It touches on almost every area of economic activity -- from how citizens heat their homes and commute, to a total upheaval of manufacturing practices.Unprecedented heat, hundreds dead and a town destroyed. Climate change is frying the Northern HemisphereThe EU last month enshrined in law its target to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, but on Wednesday unveiled the aggressive 10-step program, titled ""Fit for 55,"" which is a roadmap for how it will achieve its reduction.At a press conference in Brussels on Wednesday, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that Europe had become the first continent with ""a comprehensive architecture"" to meet its climate ambitions.""We have the goal, but now we present the roadmap to how we are going to get there,"" she said.Read More""We know, for example, our current fossil fuel economy has reached its limits. And we know we have to move on to new model one that is powered by innovation, that has clean energy that is moving toward a circular economy.""While the package is bold, climate activists have criticized the 55% target for not being strong enough to prevent global temperatures from rising to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, which scientists say is necessary to stave off more severe impacts of climate change.The European Union accounts for around 8% of the world's carbon emissions from fossil fuels. Containing rising temperatures will need firm action from bigger economies, including the US and China, the world's two biggest carbon emitters. The plan is also unlikely to be implemented in the way that von der Leyen and her fellow commissioners have envisioned. First, it must go through the EU's exhaustive legislative process, which could take many months, even years. It will need to be read, amended and approved by both lawmakers in the EU Parliament and the EU Council, the forum in which the elected leaders of each member state debate such matters. What else is in the roadmap?The plans -- which form part of von der Leyen's broader Green Deal, a key plank of her Commission's 2019-2024 agenda -- takes particular aim at transport, both personal and commercial, across the block.Von der Leyen announced cars with combustion engines, for example, would not be produced within the bloc from 2035. Financial incentives would be offered to countries that replace traditional fuel with a sustainable alternative in aviation and maritime transportation.'Fit for 55' proposalsA carbon tax for selected imports that are emissions heavy An end to combustible engine cars by 2035Target to produce 40% of energy from renewable sources by 2030A phase-out of free emission allowances for aviation Lowering the cap of the Emissions Trading System (ETS)An inclusion of shipping emissions in the ETSTarget to plant 3 billion trees by 2030, part of an effort to remove 310 million tons of carbon from the atmosphereTarget for land use to be carbon neutral buy 2035The proposed carbon border would place tariffs on certain goods produced outside the bloc, depending on their carbon footprint, subjecting them to the same standards that already exist for goods produced within the EU.The plans is to discourage EU companies from importing cheaper materials from places where environmental standards are lower. In the initial implementation, the sectors affected would include cement, iron and steel, aluminum, fertilizer and, crucially, electricity.Minimum tax rate for petrol and gasoline fuels would be increased by significant margins, as would tax on kerosene.Another key pillar of Wednesday's package is a lowering of the cap in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), the world's first and largest carbon market. Created in 2005, the ETS works by placing a cap on the carbon emissions companies within the EU are allowed to produce each year. If a company goes over, they are fined. They can also buy ""allowances"" from others in the ETS, roll over unused allowances. Over time, the cap set by the ETS goes down across the entire carbon market.Presenting the package, von der Leyen said that these measures, which would cost €500bn ""at the Europe level alone"" would also create financial ""incentives for the private sector, so that they complement"" the EU's overall ambition.Is it realistic?There is likely to be pushback against many of the proposals within the EU. EU officials admitted to CNN that even getting the college of commissioners to agree on what von der Leyen put forward on Wednesday was a struggle.Some member states are poorer than others, meaning the transition to Brussels' goals are harder, while other member states have economies built on industries that by their nature produce more emissions.Climate change is fueling mass-casualty heat waves. Here's why experts say we don't view them as crisesIt will also be politically difficult, as member states are currently divided on many other pan-European issues -- from rule of law to human rights -- and will likely use this debate on climate change as a proxy for other ongoing rows.EU diplomats told CNN that they expected opposition from countries like Poland and Hungary, who are currently embroiled with the European Commission, but also potentially wealthy and powerful nations like Germany, which has a mixed history on climate change due to its large manufacturing base. But there are also many Members of European Parliament who think the proposals don't go far enough. If the Council waters down von der Leyen's initial text to appease opposing member states, there is also the possibility that parliamentary objection could grow. ""The proposals presented by the Commission, postpones the most stringent climate measures until the past 2030,"" said Michael Bloss, a German MEP sitting in the parliament's Green group. ""In their proposal, free allowances for industry will only end in 2036, the kerosene tax only applies fully as of 2030 and the internal combustion engine will only be phased out in 2035. Although it is technologically and economically possible to implement these policies earlier, in this form, the Green Deal will not be enough to limit global warming to 1.5C,"" he said.On the other side of the debate, MEPs like Gunar Beck -- who represents the right-wing nationalist Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD), Germany's largest opposition party -- say that while they don't dispute a need to tackle climate change globally, the EU's position could have negative effects. ""Even if the EU becomes carbon neutral, other developing countries will rapidly increase their emissions. What it will do is worsen the competitive position of EU companies and further impair the EU's economic recovery,"" he said. If negotiations drag for years, von der Leyen and her allies may not even be around to see them through, as their mandate ends in November 2024. While climate change is not going to be dropped from the EU agenda any time soon, the political makeup of the bloc could change radically in that time. There are elections in Germany and France that could shake up both countries within the next year and, post-pandemic, the political direction for the future of the EU is uncertain."

Italy also boasts an exciting group of talented youngsters, headed up by Federico Chiesa and player of the tournament Gianluigi Donnarumma, which will give Azzurri fans hope that this team can continue to compete for major international trophies for the foreseeable future.New Bayern Munich coach Julian Nagelsmann is a huge fan of Chiesa, telling Bild am Sonntag that the Juventus star embodies ""incredible verve and dynamism.""In his Euro 2020 squad, Mancini seemed to find the perfect balance between veteran experience and youthful exuberance, with young stars such as Locatelli, Alessandro Bastoni, Nicolo Barella and Matteo Pessina already proving they can handle the pressure on the biggest stage.""The great beauty shown from the Italian players: it's not only the game but also friendship and hope that this will inspire our sector and reform the Italian football,"" Gravina said.""A great beauty, expression of renaissance and sportive humanism to which the federation deeply care about. ""This national team fights, exults and rejoices, it's everyone's team and driven from true feelings. I cannot and don't want to forget any single person who built this path to this moment. ""Thank you Azzurri, we are even more happy and proud to be Italian.""READ: Italy crowned European champion after beating England on penaltiesGiorgio Chiellini drags Bukayo Saka after being turned by the England forward.In Italy, much of the praise for the rejuvenation of the team has been heaped on Mancini. Newspaper Tuttosport thanked the head coach, calling him a ""magnificent visionary.""""Mancini ... the re-builder of a national team that dissolved on the cursed night of November 13, 2017,"" the paper wrote, referencing the night Italy failed to qualify for the World Cup. ""Rebuilt by Mancini in three years.""Mancini, who changed the mentality, the game, the perspective of an Italy that is madly beautiful and therefore unique. Mancini, who on the first day as coach said: 'I will take you to the final and we will win it.'""Tuttosport couldn't resist at dig at England, too, with Italians seemingly taking plenty of joy from beating Gareth Southagte's side on home soil at Wembley Stadium.""Respectfully speaking, the Azzurri have taught a lesson to the masters who invented football, but for fifty-five years they have tried in vain to show that they still know how to teach it,"" it said.""Taught a lesson"" may be a bit exaggerated given the match finished as a draw after 120 minutes, but it shows the sense pride the nation took from coming to lift the Henri Delaunay Trophy.Ciro Immobile and Lorenzo Insigne celebrate with the Euro 2020 trophy.Instead of ""football coming home,"" football went back to Rome. On Monday, the national team were welcomed by Italian president Sergio Mattarella and then prime minister Mario Draghi, before taking the trophy on an open-top bus parade around Rome in front of thousands of fans.""Football has come home!"" Corriere dello Sport wrote triumphantly. ""To ours, though.

France and Greece both announced new vaccine requirements on Monday, following in the footsteps of Italy, which made vaccinations compulsory for health employees in April. The UK government, which is pushing ahead with its unlocking plan despite strong warnings from experts, has previously said it will mandate shots for care home staff from October. Not all health care workers are happy with the move. In Italy, several court challenges launched by those who do not want to get vaccinated are being heard this week. In the UK, a petition against the plan to make vaccines compulsory has attracted more than 72,000 signatures. Delta variant's trajectory in UK and Israel provides hope for US -- if we can keep vaccinatingFrench President Emmanuel Macron announced on Monday that health care workers, care home employees and those who work with vulnerable and frail patients in France will have to be vaccinated by September 15. Speaking on LCI television following Macron's announcement, health minister Olivier Véran added that unvaccinated health care workers will be banned from going to work and will not be paid after the September deadline. Read MoreMacron also hinted at the possibility of making the shot mandatory for everyone if the epidemic worsens. ""Depending on the situation, no doubt we will have to ask ourselves the question of mandatory vaccination for all the French,"" he said. ""I have made the choice of trust and I am appealing to all our non-vaccinated countrymen to go and get vaccinated as soon as possible,"" he added.Meanwhile, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced on Monday that vaccinations will be mandatory for nursing home staff, effective immediately. Those who refuse will be suspended from work starting August 16, he said, adding that from September, vaccinations will be compulsory for all health care workers in both public and private sectors.Mitsotakis said that, starting on Friday and until the end of August, only those who have had the vaccine will be able to visit indoor commercial areas like entertainment centers, bars, theaters and cinemas.""The country will not shut down again because of the attitude of some,"" he said, adding that ""it is not Greece that is in danger, but the unvaccinated Greeks.""Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel said Tuesday that her government had decided not to make vaccines compulsory, adding that she believed many more people still wanted to get vaccinated. She said it was up to the authorities to make both information and vaccines more accessible. She stressed that the country's Covid restrictions would not be lifted until more people have got their shots.  New restrictions across EuropeThe moves by France and Greece come as both countries -- and indeed most of Europe -- see a steep increase in cases of the coronavirus caused by the Delta variant. The strain, first identified in India earlier this year, is more transmissible and has spread across the world in recent months. Scientists condemn UK's 'dangerous and unethical' reopening plansThere are also worries, based on statements from the Israeli government, that existing Covid-19 vaccines may be slightly less effective in preventing all infections caused by the Delta variant, compared to previous strains. The shots do appear to be highly effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths. The threat posed by the Delta variant has prompted several European governments to reintroduce restrictions in recent days. The Netherlands reinstated curbs on nightclubs and restaurants on Friday after seeing a spike in cases. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte apologized for easing the restrictions at the end of June, telling reporters on Monday that it had been an ""error in judgment.""The Spanish regions of Valencia and Catalonia have introduced new restrictions on social gatherings and hospitality, while Portugal has reinstated a curfew in some high-risk areas and said it would start requiring tourists to show a negative test or a vaccination certificate in order to stay in hotels. Even as most of Europe steps on the emergency brake, the UK government remains adamant that it will drop nearly all remaining coronavirus restrictions in England next week. Prime Minister Boris Jonson confirmed on Monday that the easing will happen despite a steep increase in Covid cases; he admitted this would lead to ""more hospitalizations and more deaths from Covid.""He justified the move by pointing to the country's high vaccination rate and added that it was better to open the economy now, when schools are closed for summer holiday and the weather is good.Coronavirus variants: Here's what we know""If we were now to delay this fourth step [in the reopening process] -- for instance to September or later -- then we would be reopening as the weather gets colder and as the virus acquires a greater natural advantage and when schools are back,"" he said at a news conference on Monday. The decision to push ahead comes despite stark warnings from experts and medical professionals. The British Medical Association (BMA), the doctors' trade union, called the government's plan ""irresponsible and perilous.""""Scrapping the remaining restrictions next week -- when a significant proportion of the population will not have been fully vaccinated -- will give this deadly virus an opportunity to re-tighten its grip; pushing infection rates up, increasing hospitalizations and people ill with long-Covid, risking new vaccine-resistant variants developing, and putting more lives at unnecessary risk,"" Dr. Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA's council chair, said in a statement. The UK has fully vaccinated roughly half of its population, with two thirds of adults now fully vaccinated and 87% having had at least one shot.

Stay home. Get tested. Book your vaccination,"" reads an on-screen message in the 30-second ad, seemingly intended to illustrate the risks posed to young people by the highly-contagious Delta variant.The ad, which began airing Sunday night in Sydney, ""is quite graphic, and it's meant to be graphic,"" Australia's chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said during a news conference Sunday. ""We are only doing this because of the (Covid-19) situation."" While Australia has fared better than many other developed nations in keeping infections relatively low, Sydney has seen case numbers surge in recent weeks as the Delta variant takes hold. In response to the outbreak, restrictions have tightened in Australia's largest city, with tough rules in place limiting outdoor gatherings, exercise and shopping. New South Wales, of which Sydney is the capital, reported 112 new locally transmitted cases Monday, almost all in Sydney, despite the strict lockdown measures. Read MoreThe new government ad is part of a broader Covid-19 health campaign highlighting the seriousness of the latest outbreak, however, many Australians have expressed concern over its use of ""insensitive"" scare tactics, and what many perceive to be muddled, contradictory messaging. Bill Bowtell, adjunct professor at the University of New South Wales and strategic health policy consultant, said the ad is ""misconceived in every possible way."" The young woman shown struggling to breathe is of particular concern, according to Bowtell. Under Australia's current vaccine rollout, most people under the age of 40 are not able to receive the recommended Pfizer-​BioNTech vaccination, he said. ""Every piece of health communication should be tasteful, has to have integrity and honesty. This fails in that regard,"" Bowtell added.Earlier this month, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that people under the age of 40 could ask their general practitioner for an AstraZeneca shot even if they were not yet eligible to get a vaccine, reversing a policy that previously gave priority to high-risk groups such as health care workers and the elderly. However, Morrison's comments were widely contradicted by senior health officials, many of whom cited guidance provided by the government's own advisory group on immunization, suggesting young people wait to receive the Pfizer-​BioNTech vaccine, owing to the reduced risk of rare blood clotting events. As a result of the mixed messaging, take-up of the AstraZeneca shot has been low, while shortages of the Pfizer-​BioNTech shot have continued to hamper Australia's nationwide rollout. As of Sunday, just over 9 million vaccine doses have been administered across the country, according to the Department of Health. Just 9% of the population has been fully vaccinated, according to CNN's Covid-19 vaccine tracker.Addressing the backlash against the new government health ad Monday, Morrison said there will ""always"" be criticism. ""I know that, and it was only a few weeks ago that our very critics were saying that the advertising needed to be stronger, far stronger, even making references to grim reapers,"" he told CNN affiliate Sky News Australia. ""[The ad] has two messages... one is to stay at home,"" Morrison added. ""We can't be complacent about this. And young people moving around the city was putting people at risk right across the community, including themselves."""

CNN has reached out to the Georgian police and the interior ministry for comment regarding these allegations but has not received a response.Several media organizations issued a statement Monday, criticizing the Prime Minister for having called on the event organizers to cancel the Pride march, blaming them for any ""possible complication"" that may arise from the situation.Eastern Europe was once a world leader on gay rights. Then it ran out of scapegoatsThe statement said counterdemonstrators ""deliberately attacked the media representatives, subjected them to physical and verbal abuse, and deliberately destroyed their equipment to obstruct their journalistic activities.""

The team is led by Jean-Pierre Wolf, a Swiss physicist who's been working with laser for more than 20 years and has been particularly fascinated with attempting to control the weather with it. Laser creates very narrow, high-energy beams of light. Its applications range from cutting diamonds to surgery to reading barcodes, and Wolf believes he can add another to the list: protecting us from lightning.He's leading an EU-funded consortium which includes universities in Paris and Lausanne, as well as rocket manufacturer ArianeGroup and the maker of the laser, German high-tech company Trumpf. After a year of delays due to the pandemic, the laser has been transported to the summit of Säntis, a mountain in the Swiss alps with an elevation of 2,500 meters (8,200 feet).""This is one of the places in Europe that's struck by lightning the most,"" explained Wolf. ""There is a radio transmission tower there which gets struck 100 to 400 times a year. So it's an ideal place to make our proof-of-concept experiments.""Read MoreArtificial lightningLightning forms when turbulent air within a thundercloud violently tosses around ice crystals and water droplets, stripping electrons from their atoms and creating separate zones with opposite electric charges. A robot suitcase could replace canes and guide dogs for blind peopleThese electric fields can become very strong, and because opposite charges attract, they can connect through a discharge of electricity -- what we call lightning.The laser mimics and enhances this natural scenario by generating an electric field so strong that it rips electrons off their atoms directly, setting up the opposite charges that are necessary for lightning to form. The idea is to make the clouds discharge lightning in a controlled way. ""That's why we call it a laser lightning rod,"" said Wolf.The beam will run alongside the existing transmission tower -- which is over 120 meters (about 400 feet) tall.The laser has been taken to a radio transmission tower at the summit of Säntis, in the Swiss alps.Traditional lightning rods are only able to protect a limited area on the ground, no matter how high they are built. Wolf hopes that the laser, however, will help protect a larger area on the ground, although he can't yet say how much larger. The theory is that the laser can act both as a lightning rod, catching bolts that would strike anyway, and also trigger extra ones.""That would mean we would be unloading the thundercloud, reducing its voltage and then preventing further lightning strikes in the surrounding area,"" said Wolf.Wolf says that the most immediate practical applications of the technology would be to protect rockets -- such as those carrying satellites into orbit -- during launches, and at airports, where it could be turned on during storms.Paramedics test jet suit that can fly up mountainsHe added that the demand for lightning protection is vast, and that the costs associated with lightning strikes, especially from air traffic disruption, could be in the billions of dollars each year in the US alone. Research also shows that increased lightning strikes could be among the effects of climate change.Read: Artist uses VR to protect sea lifeThe European Commission is backing the project through an initiative that supports early-stage scientific research. It says that globally, lightning kills between 6,000 and 24,000 people each year, as well as causing billions of euros of damage to electronics and infrastructure, making it ""a major societal concern.""It adds that the project is expected to lead to safer air transport and reduced flight delays during intense thunderstorms.A huge laserThe laser will draw power from the antenna facility, and was brought to the mountaintop disassembled, in a complex operation that involved multiple trips via cable car and helicopter.""It's a huge laser -- it takes a large truck to transport it, which is why it was built like a puzzle, with modules that can be put together on site,"" said Wolf. The one-year pandemic delay let the team run more tests of the laser in a lab in Paris, pictured here.A total of 29 tons of material were hauled, including 18 tons of concrete blocks to anchor the laser array to its base. ""We get 120 mph winds here, so that was needed to stabilize the structure, or it could easily be shifted or even fly off,"" said Wolf.Assembly took two weeks, and the laser is now ready to be switched on, bad weather permitting -- which in this case means hoping for it.The laser shoots 1,000 times per second and it's so powerful that ""a single pulse at peak power is equal to that produced by all the nuclear power plants in the world,"" according to Wolf -- but only for an extremely short time.For safety reasons, a five-kilometer wide no-fly zone will be in place when the laser is active. Although it poses no risk to aircraft, laser is harmful to human eyes when looking directly at the source (looking at the beam from the mountain or from the air while not directly on top of it is fine, says Wolf). How a high-tech car helped Lewis Hamilton's brother Nicolas overcome his disability to become a racing driverThe laser won't be switched on all the time, but rather only when increased lightning activity is detected. On the mountain, special camera equipment will photograph lightning bolts 300,000 times per second, to see how closely they will follow the laser beam and at which altitude.""One interesting thing is that, due to the high peak power, our laser will change color,"" said Wolf. ""It will go from red to white as it propagates in the air. It will be really cool to see.""Tests will last until September, the end of lightning season. If they are successful, the next experiment could be at an airport, Wolf said, and the technology could be ready in a few years.""We'll know fairly soon if we're successful or not, although analyzing the data in detail will take more time,"" he added. ""But I think that at the end of September we will either open a bottle of champagne or a bottle of whiskey, if you see what I mean."""

Opponents see a chance to turn his nationalist rhetoric against him,"(CNN)A derelict plot on the banks of the Danube River in Budapest, Hungary, might seem like an unusual epicenter for a political earthquake.But that was before Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's populist government announced a controversial plan for a prestigious Shanghai university to open its first overseas campus there in 2024 -- which Hungarians would apparently pay for.Now protests over the future of this nondescript site have galvanized Hungary's opposition, and united them in an attempt to topple Orbán's ruling party at next year's general election. Since Orbán swept to power 11 years ago, there have been plenty of demonstrations in Budapest against his assault on democratic freedoms. The self-styled defender of Christian values in Europe has rolled back civil liberties, ranging from migrant and LGBTQ rights to media freedom, as well as judicial and academic independence. Not that it's hurt Orbán's political fortunes. His right-wing Fidesz party has enjoyed landslide election wins, with no serious political challenger outside Budapest. Read MoreBut the proposed Fudan University campus has become a potent issue.The Fudan campus is planned for construction at this site in Budapest, Hungary, seen on April 23, 2021.Its critics point to the huge cost to Hungary, warning that taxpayer money would be used to serve the interests of China's Communist Party. What's more, they say the campus would be built on land slated for affordable housing for around 10,000 Hungarian students.  Thousands of protesters took to the streets in Budapest last month to oppose the plan, carrying placards emblazoned with the word ""treason"" and slogans such as ""Hungarian money for Hungarian universities.""Orbán has made great political capital out of promoting ""traditional"" Hungarian values. The opposition now appears to be serving the populist leader a dose of his own medicine. The Fudan University controversy is ""about whether this small country of 10 million can finally decide its own fate, about whether we will really be a free nation,"" opposition leader and Budapest Mayor Gergely Karácsony told demonstrators in the capital, according to local media reports.""To an extent right now, the opposition has turned Orbán's rhetoric against him,"" said Péter Krekó, director of Budapest-based think tank Political Capital.Krekó said Orbán had adopted an image of himself as ""the greatest defender of sovereignty -- from the United States, from Brussels, from Berlin."" Now the Prime Minister is effectively opening the door to Chinese interests -- and ""that's hard to explain"" to voters, he said.""China's image in central eastern Europe is not very favorable,"" added Krekó. ""This is something that can be easily exploited by the opposition.""JUST WATCHEDHow Viktor Orbán used the pandemic to take on extra powers (April, 2020) ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow Viktor Orbán used the pandemic to take on extra powers (April, 2020)  02:35Orbán looks EastIn a drastic move, six of Hungary's opposition parties are putting aside their political differences to run jointly against Fidesz in 2022's parliamentary election. They include Karácsony's green party, Dialogue for Hungary, the former far-right party Jobbik, and young centrist party Momentum. This opposition coalition is yet to announce its candidate for prime minister, though the pro-European Union (EU) Karácsony is considered the frontrunner.In a joint letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping on June 22, the opposition leaders said that, if elected next year, they would ""immediately halt"" the university project and another planned Beijing-backed railway link between Budapest and Belgrade. Hungary and China agreed a 20-year, $1.9 billion loan deal for the railway, to be built by a consortium of Hungarian and Chinese firms. But much like the university campus, the railway has been criticized in Hungary over a lack of transparency in government dealings with China.The controversial business ventures are all part of Orbán's ""Eastern Opening"" policy. In the wake of the global financial crisis and increasing tensions with the EU, the Prime Minister has increasingly sought to attract Chinese investment.""I think Orbán really deeply believes in the decline of the West, and that the East is on the rise,"" Krekó said of the Prime Minister's ideology. ""And therefore, if you have to bet on who are the future leaders of the world, then it's better to turn to China, than to the United States.""So far, that policy has brought Hungary limited economic results. But it has created closer ties between the two countries. Hungary was the only member state to block an EU statement condemning China's new security law in Hong Kong, and it was the first EU country to approve Chinese vaccines.Budapest Mayor Gergely Karacsony, adresses protesters. The Winnie the Pooh toy is a reference to Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who critics say bears a resemblance to the character.A broad alliance This is not the first time Hungary's opposition parties have joined forces. The same tactic paid off in 2019's municipal elections when Karácsony scored a shock win against the Fidesz-backed Budapest mayor. Whether they can replicate that success at a national level is another question. Were Orbán to be defeated, it's no secret that EU lawmakers would largely breathe a sigh of relief, said Dermot Hodson, associate professor of political economy at Birkbeck College, University of London.Last month, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Hungary ""has no place"" in the EU after the country passed a controversial new bill banning LGBTQ content in schools -- the latest in a long list of provocations to the bloc's core values.For EU leaders, ""Orbán has been a real headache in many ways,"" said Hodson, describing Hungary as a ""challenger government.""""Pushing back against the European Union, but wanting to stay within it, is a very damaging combination,"" he added. After the recent protests, the government announced a public referendum on the university -- but said it would be held after the election.Meanwhile, Hungary's Parliament -- where Fidesz holds a supermajority -- voted in mid-June to donate state-owned land to a foundation in charge of the planned university campus.On the same day, the Parliament also passed its anti-LGBTQ law, prompting further protests in Budapest and outrage from EU leaders in Brussels.The timing of the anti-LGBTQ legislation was ""all part of an effort to divert the attention from the Fudan project,"" said Krekó. ""Because the government feels this is something dangerous for their identity.""The law also served another purpose for Orbán: It splintered the opposition alliance after Jobbik joined Fidesz in voting for it.  'Decline of the West'A major sticking point for critics of the university plan is the cost -- reportedly more than the budget for Hungary's entire education system.According to leaked documents obtained by investigative journalism outlet Direkt36, the project would cost an estimated €1.5 billion ($1.8 billion), mostly financed through a loan from a Chinese state bank. The building work, on land originally slated for Hungarian student accommodation, would be carried out by a Chinese contractor, it added.Critics have raised eyebrows over the nature of a deal under which Hungarian taxpayers would effectively be paying for Fudan to set up its campus. According to the Direkt36 report, the so-called Fudan Hungary University would be established and maintained by a Chinese-Hungarian asset management foundation -- suggesting joint revenue from the project.CNN contacted Fudan University for a comment on the loan, but had not received a reply at time of publishing.The Hungarian government also did not comment on the reported cost of the loan in a lengthy statement to CNN. However it did say that 6,000 to 8,000 students from ""Hungary, China and other nations"" would learn from 500 lecturers at the campus' economics, humanities, engineering and medical science facilities.The Hungarian government added that Fudan University was already collaborating with five German universities, 24 Scandinavian universities and had an academic partnership with Yale University in the US. ""If they manage to protect their national security interests, we are capable of that, too,"" it added. Protesters march in Budapest on June 5 during a demonstration against the planned Fudan University campus.Nonetheless, two-thirds of Hungarians who have heard about the project oppose the Fudan University plan, according to a poll by liberal think tank Republikon Institute. And the university controversy could cut through to Orbán supporters outside of Budapest, said Tamás Matura, assistant professor at Budapest's Corvinus University and founder of the Central and Eastern European Center for Asian Studies.He pointed to Direkt36's investigation revealing the original student housing planned for the site would be scrapped.""Average people who would love to send their children to the capital city to study at university"" understand there is ""a chance that their own children will have less access to cheap accommodation, because the Chinese have taken away that that opportunity,"" he said. The Hungarian government told CNN in a statement that the proposed campus would ""not be taking space away"" from the planned student accommodation.Matura said that Fudan was one of the world's best universities. But he also feared the Shanghai institution's deep financial pockets could draw the best professors and students from ""under-financed"" Hungarian universities. Critics also fear academic freedom would be undermined by the university's allegiance to the Chinese Communist Party. All of which comes against the backdrop of Orbán's controversial university reforms, which critics say extend the ideological imprint of the ruling right-wing government.Indeed the George Soros-backed Central European University (CEU) was ""forced out"" of Budapest, after a years-long assault on its academic freedoms by Orbán's government. The university relocated to Vienna, prompting protests in the Hungarian capital. Fudan is a ""kind of second part of that political story unfolding,"" said Hodson. ""This is a pushback on Orbán's continuous assault on freedoms,"" he added, but pointed out that ""there's a kind of progressive bastion in Budapest.""Hodson cast doubt on whether demonstrations in the capital could seriously dent Orbán's re-election chances elsewhere in Hungary.In protest at the university plans, Budapest's local authorities are renaming streets near the campus after prominent human rights causes about which the Chinese government is sensitive, including the Dalai Lama and the Uyghurs.The Hungarian government called Budapest's move ""infantile"" in a statement to CNN. And China's foreign ministry called the behavior ""contemptible.""These are literal signs of protest. The big question is whether this resistance in Budapest also points the way to meaningful change in Hungary."

The national team has now lost seven out of 10 shootouts in major tourrnaments.Marcus Rashford misses England's third penalty in the shootout.Manuel Locatelli and Giorgio Chiellini of Italy celebrate as Jadon Sancho looks dejected after missing England's fourth penalty.Italy's goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma saves Bukayo Saka's penalty.Saka is just 19 and only made his England debut in October and the relative youth of that English trio, who missed their penalties and have subsequently been subjected to online racist abuse, has led to criticism from one former international player that more experienced England stars should have taken the penalties.Read More""If you're (Raheem) Sterling or (Jack) Grealish, you cannot sit there and have a young kid [Saka] go up for a penalty ahead of you, you can't,"" said former Republic of Ireland international Roy Keane.""You cannot let a shy 19-year-old go up in front of you. They have a lot more experience, Sterling has won trophies, they had to get in front of the young kid and stand up.""Jack Grealish and Harry Maguire look disconsolate following England's defeat.Grealish took exception to that criticism, tweeting: ""The gaffer [Southgate] has made so many right decisions through this tournament and he did tonight.""But I won't have people say that I didn't want to take a peno when I said I will.""Love hearts and slogans, placed by a local resident, are stuck on the plastic that covers offensive graffiti on the vandalised mural of Rashford on the wall of a cafe on Copson Street, Withington in Manchester.After the final, Southgate said that he had decided on the penalty takers based on the players' performance in training.""Nobody is on their own,"" Southgate told the BBC. ""We have won together as a team and it is on all of us together to not be able to win this game.""In terms of penalties, it is my call and it totally rests with me. I decided on the penalty takers based on what they have done in training.""But Southgate has also faced criticism given Sancho and Rashford were brought on as substitutes in the 120th minute, just before the shootout started.That gave them little or no time to prepare for such a significant moment in the match, especially as England hasn't won an international tournament for 55 years.""In reality it is very hard for [Marcus] Rashford and [Jadon] Sancho to come and take a penalty after one touch of the ball,"" said AS Roma manager Jose Mourinho."

The England manager has just guided the nation to its first men's major tournament final in 55 years -- England played Italy on Sunday -- but there were no theatrics on the touchline from the 50-year-old. He looked calm, let out a sigh of relief and quickly commiserated with the Denmark coach. He then turned and welcomed the embrace of his backroom team before applauding the fans at Wembley Stadium for their vociferous and passionate support. The moment encapsulated everything you need to know about Southgate.He may have what has been frequently described as the ""impossible job,"" but his tenure has made everything seem possible, even if England did lose Sunday's final after a penalty shootout.Read MoreSouthgate's management style is ego light. It's never about him; it's always about others. His attitude and approach to leadership has been hailed from both inside and outside the world of football during Euro 2020 and is undoubtedly a huge contributing factor to this team's success. Former England international Gary Neville pointedly compared Southgate's leadership skills to those of Britain's political class.""The standard of leaders in this country over the last couple of years has been poor but looking at that man there, that's everything a leader should be,"" said Neville as Southgate celebrated the semifinal win at Wembley, a match watched on UK television by nearly 26 million viewers in the UK. ""Respectful, humble, tells the truth, genuine, He's fantastic Gareth Southgate. He really is unbelievable and has done a great job.,"" added Neville.When Southgate took the national job in 2016, he was far from a popular choice. He had been managing the England Under-21 side, but  was put in charge of the senior team on a temporary basis following Sam Allardyce's resignation.At the time, it felt like an uninspired choice -- a stopgap whilst the English Football Association found someone more experienced, more glamorous, to fill the vacancy full time. READ: England reaches first major final since 1966 after tense Euro 2020 victory over DenmarkGareth Southgate celebrates his side's victory against Denmark at Wembley Stadium.Southgate's humble journey Before moving into the national set-up, Southgate had only managed Middlesbrough for three years and his reputation in the country was far from glowing. While Southgate was Middlesbrough manager the club was relegated from the Premier League in 2009 and in October of that year he was sacked. He spent four years in the wilderness before taking charge of the England Under-21 team in 2013.Many England fans still remembered Southgate as the man who missed the decisive penalty against Germany at Euro 1996. The defender was ridiculed for years after and, until now, has struggled to shake off that association. ""For the teammates that played with me, I can't change that so that's always going to hurt. But what's lovely that is we've given people another day to remember,"" said Southgate after guiding England to victory against international nemesis Germany in the round of 16. After winning his first game as caretaker boss, England responded well to Southgate and his stock began to grow.In November 2016, he was handed the job on a permanent basis and started working on his long-time plan of giving the national side a new identity. A lot of effort went into getting every age group of the national set-up playing the same way which made transition into the first team easier. Lionel Messi faces old friend Neymar in last bid for Copa America glory with ArgentinaIt bore fruit in 2018, when an unfancied England reached the semifinals of the World Cup. The fairytale journey started to convert even the most ardent of critics and now, after reaching the final of Euro 2020, few doubt Southgate's suitability anymore. ""I massively questioned his pedigree to manage a country,"" one England fan told CNN ahead of England's semfinal against Denmark.""I think Gareth's rise through the ranks has allowed him to learn each step of the way and relate to the players. ""He just seems to have this mindset of learning from success and bringing that into our system. As a naysayer before, I'm now the biggest fan. He's just awesome"" Southgate has also managed to change the often hostile dynamic that has existed between the England team and the British media.When England exited Euro 1992 after being beaten by Sweden, former England manager Graham Taylor was caricatured as a turnip in The Sun newspaper, next to a headline which read ""Swedes 2 Turnips 1."" In 2007, Taylor told BBC Radio about incidents where people ""wanted to actually do me physical hurt and felt that they could talk to me as they wish"" as a result of the picture.At every step of the way, Southgate has encouraged the team to express themselves both on and off the pitch and offered unwavering support to players like Raheem Sterling who have spoken out about social issues.Before Euro 2020, Southgate also wrote an open letter -- entitled ""Dear England"" -- to the fans about racism in the country and fully backed the team's decision to take the knee before every game in this tournament. ""This is a special group. Humble, proud and liberated in being their true selves,"" wrote Southgate in The Players' Tribune.The letter was published after his team was booed by a minority of fans for taking the knee -- as a stand against racism -- in warm-up matches ahead of the tournament.""It's their [the players] duty to continue to interact with the public on matters such as equality, inclusivity and racial injustice, while using the power of their voices to help put debates on the table, raise awareness and educate,"" added Southgate.Both the Southgate and his players have remained unapologetic about using the gesture ahead of kick-offs at Euro 2020, despite criticism from some UK lawmakers of the ruling Conservative party.""I have never believed that we should just stick to football,"" continued Southgate in his letter.""It's their duty to continue to interact with the public on matters such as equality, inclusivity and racial injustice, while using the power of their voices to help put debates on the table, raise awareness and educate.""READ: Pulisic under fire from animal rights group following stunt involving vulnerable speciesGareth Southgate reacts after missing his penalty in 1996. 'Nice guy' with ruthless streak If Southgate relied on star players like captain Harry Kane and Sterling to fire his team to the Euro 2020 final, he has always made point of valuing each and every member of the squad, even those yet to feature in the tournament.Most managers after a victory would be focus on goalscorers and the team's success, but not Southgate.""I'm thinking of the lads we didn't get on the pitch -- Conor Coady, Ben Chilwell, Sam Johnstone, Aaron Ramsdale, they're the ones making this team successful,"" Southgate told the BBC after beating Ukraine in the quarterfinals last week. ""The spirit in the group is phenomenal. Whoever comes in does the job, whoever isn't in -- it is really difficult to leave three out of the matchday squad -- the squad mentality is fantastic. That's uppermost in my mind, looking after those guys."" Southgate has proved you can be a 'nice guy' and still succeed in a cutthroat industry but don't confuse his personable approach with softness. When the time has come, Southgate has demonstrated his ability to be ruthless and puts nothing above the success of the teamNotably he dropped Trent Alexander-Arnold from his squad earlier in the season when his club form dipped, though the Liverpool defender was then recalled, before picking up an injury and ruling him out of Euro 2020.It's why Southgate's side came so close to making history and win a first major tournament since the World Cup in 1966. Like Southgate, Italy's coach Roberto Mancini has also won plaudits in the way he has gone about reinventing the Azzurri.The 56-year-old, who has got plenty of attention for his sharp dressing -- yes Armani -- at this year's tournament, took charge six months after Italy failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup final but has since overseen a run of 33 unbeaten matches, scoring 86 goals and conceding just 10.Mancini's side has produced mesmerizing performances at Euro 2020 with its cavalier style of attacking football, allied to the foundations of traditional Italian defending. ""Believing in your work, having a vision, having a perspective can actually carry you beyond your borders and limits,"" Italian journalist Tancredi Palmeri told CNN's World Sport after Italy beat Belgium in the quarterfinals.""When, three years ago, Roberto Mancini took the job on the Italian bench, possibly he was the only one believing that something like this was possible. ""There wasn't any particular young players that would set them apart, there wasn't any tactical project that wasn't considered. Possibly in that moment, Roberto Mancini was believing, and we Italians were hoping, that it could be true."""

England's wait to end its wretched run in major international competitions, stretching all the way back to 1966, will go for at least another year until the World Cup is hosted in Qatar.Few would have expected Italy, which failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, to reach the final prior to the start of Euro 2020, much less win the entire competition, but Roberto Mancini's side quickly established itself as one of the contenders after three thrilling group stage performances.Gianluigi Donnarumma, Italy's hero in the penalty shootout with two fine saves, was deservedly named the player of the tournament and the goalkeeper heads up a group of talented stars that should ensure this side remains competitive for the foreseeable future. As for England, this defeat is likely to sting for quite some time to come for players and fans alike, but the squad at least has the consolation of knowing it has provided the country with a tournament run not seen for more than five decades.AnticipationWembley Way, the famous road leading up to England's national stadium, was heaving as many as seven hours before kick off.Many of the fans here in the early afternoon didn't even have tickets, instead choosing to just soak up the atmosphere before moving on to watch the match elsewhere.The fridges that stocked beer in one of the grocery stores closest to Wembley Stadium were almost completely empty by late morning.For the vast majority of fans in attendance, this was something they had never experienced in their lifetimes. It had been 55 long years since England was last in a major international final and fans have known only heartache and disappointment since that World Cup triumph in 1966.One couple considered it such a momentous occasion that they decided to get married on Wembley Way just hours before kick off, both dressed in full wedding attire and holding up England shirts with ""Mr"" and ""Mrs"" printed on the back.Even when cheering on 'golden generations' of the past, England fans have never supported their national team with a fervor quite like this. Southgate and this group of players deserve much of the credit for stirring up such a feeling of national pride.READ: Argentina beat Brazil 1-0 to win Copa AmericaFans provided an electric atmosphere inside Wembley before kick off.Stars have regularly used their platform to speak out on social issues and, when it comes to Rashford's fight against child food poverty, have even managed to reverse government policy.""I think we've got good players and ice boys, but more importantly relatable boys,"" English journalist Darren Lewis tells CNN. ""I think the secret to the success of this team is that the people in charge of the England team -- and I mean the PR team around them -- have allowed them to speak on issues that affect them, on issues that people can connect with.""They've allowed them to be normal. I remember being at the 2010 World Cup and England were keeping their players away from everyone, treating them like rock stars. I remember going down to the harbor in South Africa and the Dutch were walking around -- they were finalists that year -- walking around, talking to people, just enjoying themselves.""I think this regime who are looking after the team, they realize that it's important just to let the players be players, let them be men who people can connect with. If you walk through some parts of the crowd, I remember doing it after games and being struck by the diversity in the crowd; black, brown, white. ""Everyone wants to be a part of this England because they identify with [Raheem] Sterling, [Harry] Kane, [Tyrone] Mings, [Jordan] Henderson. They identify with these players because these players aren't detached. They care about their communities. They care about the people in the places that they come from and that means a lot to the general public.""Anyone but England?However, that feeling of goodwill towards the national team seems to extend no further than England's borders.Ahead of the final, viral memes have shown a map of Europe covered in Italian flags to signify the support of every other country on the continent.Much of the animosity towards England and its fans seems to have stemmed from the chant of ""football's coming home,"" the chorus of the 1996 song 'Three Lions' which has become the national team's adopted anthem.The song was released ahead of Euro 96, hosted in England, and is about pessimism and despair, but still feeling hope that the national team may finally end years of heartache. The Red Arrows fly overhead during the opening ceremony.However, fans of rival countries have interpreted the chant as arrogant and presumptuous, despite multiple attempts to explain its true meaning.""First of all, there is this 'It's coming home, it's coming home, it's coming' that's banging [on] since the beginning,"" Italian journalist Tancredi Palmeri told CNN. ""At the beginning it was nice, but then it sounds like: 'You owe us,' like 'it belongs to us, so you owe us' and people would say: 'No, nobody owes you anything and it doesn't belong to you.""Just look at the footage of people singing all the time 'It's coming home' for a month. It doesn't really look like, 'we are being ironic, being sarcastic.' It looks like, 'finally we are getting back what is ours.' So that is the sentiment [from the outside].""Some fans outside the stadium certainly didn't endear themselves to the watching world when they broke through the security barriers in an attempt to get into Wembley before the gates had been opened.Fast startIn the hour leading up to kick off, Wembley was thundering.Large swathes of English and Italian fans were mingling throughout the stadium, joining in chorus to belt out a number of songs that have become English anthems during Euro 2020.By the time the national anthems came around, neither of which were booed by opposition fans, Wembley felt as though its very foundations were rocking.When Shaw scored, then, with less than two minutes on the clock, the 60,000 or so fans inside the stadium raised the decibels to levels this ground has never heard before.Luke Shaw connects with Kieran Trippier's cross to open the scoring.It was a wonderful move, too, with Shaw getting on the end of Kieran Trippier's deep cross to the far post to finish off a rapid counterattack.England certainly hasn't thrilled with attacking football at this European Championships, instead its success has been built on an organized defense -- the best in the tournament -- and a smothering midfield.However, the players perhaps sensed this was an occasion like no other and put Italy on the back foot from the first whistle.Throughout Euro 2020, this Italian team has somewhat torn up the defensive blueprints that the country's national team has become synonymous with over the years. Though it still boasts tremendous defensive leadership and organization in veteran central pairing Bonucci and Gorgio Chiellini, it's been the more fluid and aggressive attacking style that has caught the eye.In the first 25 minutes of this contest, however, they had been stifled entirely by an England team that wasn't affording them a moment's rest on the ball.On the rare occasion Italy did enjoy any extended period of possession, boos rang loudly around the stadium and when a foray forward was ended by a wayward pass, England's fans erupted into rapturous cheers.Shaw's goal sent Wembley wild.Italy was still showing brief flashes of the exciting football that had got it this far -- notably through the quick-footed Lorenzo Insigne -- but its players were quickly met with a solid white wall whenever they threatened to fashion a sight of goal.Mancini's side did create one opening before the half was over through Federico Chiesa, the goal hero from Italy's semifinal win over Spain, who picked up the ball from deep and drove towards the box, but could only drag his shot wide of Jordan Pickford's post.Before the roar that greeted the referee's half time whistle, for the first time all evening Wembley had quietened down significantly; the first half had gone as perfectly as these fans could have dreamed of, perhaps they were already nervously allowing themselves to believe. Italy ralliesLess than five minutes into the second half, however, Insigne fired a direct free-kick not too far wide of Pickford's post just as a prompt reminder that this match was far from over.With Italy still struggling to create anything from open play, Mancini was forced into making a double substitution after only 50 minutes, bringing on Bryan Cristante and Domenico Berardi for Nicolo Barella the ineffective Ciro Immobile.The changes had almost the immediate desired impact, as Italy for the first time got in behind England's back line but Insigne's shot from a narrow angle was well blocked by Pickford.That chance rallied the Italian fans congregated behind Pickford's goal, who had fallen largely silent after their team's lackluster first half.This was now without question Italy's best period of the match so far, for the first time its passing was starting to pull the English defense from one side to another to force some openings.England soon retaliated, however, with John Stones rising highest in the area to head Trippier's corner towards goal and force Gianluigi Donnarumma to tip the ball over the crossbar.Leonardo Bonucci celebrates after scoring Italy's equalizer.But Italy soon got the goal its improved performance deserved. Berardi's corner to the far post somehow found its way to Marco Verratti, who saw his shot saved excellently onto the post by Pickford, but Bonucci was in the right place at the right time to tap the rebound into an empty net.Now it was the turn of the Italian fans to fill Wembley with noise, as England's supporters descended into a nervous silence with their team now on the back foot.The minor capitulation forced Gareth Southgate into making his first substitutions, as Saka and Henderson replaced Trippier and Declan Rice.It so nearly went from bad to worse for England as Bonucci's raking long ball found Berardi bearing down on goal, but the forward could only send his volley over the crossbar.England now seemed to be doubting everything that had helped them reach the final; Maguire, normally assured in defense, hacked a desperate clearance away under no pressure at all, while Kane's passes began falling short of their desired target.It was almost as if, for the first time all tournament, the magnitude of the occasion had finally started to dawn on these England players.Italian players celebrate after Bukayo Saka's penalty is saved.The game was on a knife edge as it entered the final 10 minutes, though Italian fans would certainly have been more confident than their English counterparts of snatching a win.Extra time continued in much the same vein with neither side able to stamp its authority on proceedings, both perhaps too nervous to commit at this late stage.Southgate threw on Rashford, 23, and Sancho, 21, for the penalty shootout but both men went on to miss as England suffered an all too familiar fate."

""Some of it has come from abroad, we have been told this, but some of it is from this country.""We have been a beacon of light to bring people together and the national team stands for everybody. We felt the energy and positivity from the fans and I'm incredibly proud of that,"" Southgate added.Before and during the Euro 2020 tournament, the England players have knelt before each of their matches in a display of unity in the fight against racism and inequality. Read MoreThat was an act that caused anger among sections of the England fanbase, with some supporters choosing to boo as the players knelt. London's Metropolitan Police said it was investigating the ""unacceptable"" social media comments on both Instagram and Twitter, while UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson also condemned the racist abuse. England's Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford get ready to come onto the pitch during the Euro 2020 final between England and Italy.""This England team deserve to be lauded as heroes, not racially abused on social media,"" Johnson said on Twitter. ""Those responsible for this appalling abuse should be ashamed of themselves.""In recent weeks, Johnson -- along with other lawmakers in his government such as Home Secretary Priti Patel -- have been specifically asked to condemn the England fans who have booed players taking the knee before kick-off but failed to do so. Gary Neville, former England international, criticized Johnson for not condemning those who booed the players in their battle for equality when he had the chance.""Gareth Southgate and the players a few weeks ago, about five days on the trot told us that they were taking the knee to promote equality and it was against racism,"" Neville told Sky News. ""The Prime Minister said it was ok for the population of this country to boo those players who are trying to promote equality and defend against racism. ""It starts at the very top."" ""The fact of the matter is, there is an issue obviously in football, there is an issue in society where we feel it's acceptable basically to criticize players for sporting actions because of the color of their skin,"" added Neville. Ahead of Euro 2020, Southgate penned an open letter to the country, outlining why he thought it was important for players to continue using their voice for good.""This is a special group. Humble, proud and liberated in being their true selves,"" wrote Southgate in the Players Tribune. Prince William said he was ""sickened"" by the discriminatory abuse while the Football Association in England said in a statement it was ""appalled."" The English national team's Twitter account tweeted its support for the players on Monday. ""We're disgusted that some of our squad -- who have given everything for the shirt this summer -- have been subjected to discriminatory abuse online after tonight's game.

""A full investigation will be carried out in regards to this unacceptable incident,"" it said. ""Savills abhors and has zero tolerance to any form of racism and racial discrimination and is appalled by the racist comments in these tweets. Savills is immediately investigating and will take appropriate action.""Rashford has continuously highlighted the racist abuse he's been the target of over the last few years. ""I've grown into a sport where I expect to read things written about myself. Whether it be the colour of my skin, where I grew up, or, most recently, how I decide to spend my time off the pitch,"" Rashford posted on Twitter Monday.Rashford, who missed a penalty kick in the final game, wrote that he could take ""critique of my performance all day long, my penalty was not good enough, it should have gone in, but I will never apologize for who I am and and where I came from."" In the hours after England's defeat by Italy, a mural honoring Rashford was vandalized with graffiti in Manchester, United Kingdom. The artwork commemorated the Manchester United player's work to tackle child food poverty. It features the quote: ""Take pride in knowing that your struggle will play the biggest role in your purpose.""After the mural was defaced in the early hours, part of it has been temporarily covered with bin bags. The Coffee House Cafe, where the mural is painted, shared images on Facebook of locals coming out to support Rashford.Supporters have shared messages such as ""hero"" on the wall and an image of a card next to it says: ""Dear Marcus, please know that you are so admired and people find you an inspiration.""""The messages I've received today have been positively overwhelming and seeing the response in Withington had me on the verge of tears,"" Rashford tweeted. ""The communities that always wrapped their arms around me continue to hold me up. I'm Marcus Rashford, 23 year old, black man from Withington and Wythenshawe, South Manchester. If I have nothing else I have that.""Greater Manchester Police said in a statement it is investigating the vandalism. The online abuse has led to calls for social media companies to do more to police their platforms. Earlier this year, former Arsenal forward Thierry Henry deleted his social media accounts following a spate of online racist abuse aimed at Black footballers and what he said was the inability of social media companies to hold users accountable for their actions. A few weeks after Henry had closed his accounts, English football clubs and governing bodies took part in a three-day social media blackout to protest against abuse. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, called the racist abuse ""abhorrent,"" and called on social media companies to take immediate action to ""prevent this hate."" ""Racist abuse of any kind is abhorrent and will not be tolerated on or off the pitch,"" tweeted Khan. ""MetPoliceUK (The Metropolitan Police) will investigate the appalling online abuse aimed at England players. Social media companies must take immediate action to remove and prevent this hate."" The chair for the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Julian Knight echoed Khan's sentiment. ""Social media companies once alerted to this abuse have an acute responsibility to immediately take it down,"" Knight said.""The Government needs to get on with legislating the tech giants. Enough of the foot dragging, all those who suffer at the hand of racists, not just England players, deserve better protections now.""Facebook, which owns Instagram, said in a statement sent to CNN that it was ""committed to keeping our community safe from abuse.""""No one should have to experience racist abuse anywhere, and we don't want it on Instagram,"" a Facebook Company spokesperson said.""We quickly removed comments and accounts directing abuse at England's footballers last night and we'll continue to take action against those that break our rules.

Goalkeeper Emilian Martinez celebrated what he called a Maracanazo, a remarkable win at the famous Rio stadium.""I'm speechless,"" he said. ""I knew my dream would come true, and where better than the Maracanazo and giving the title to the best in the world and fulfilling his dream.""The victory was Argentina's 15th Copa America triumph.Messi finished the tournament's joint top goalscorer with four goals and was elected joint best player along with Neymar.But he was quiet throughout the game at the Maracana stadium and uncharacteristically missed a golden opportunity to wrap the game up with two minutes remaining.When the final whistle went, Argentina TV declared ""Argentina Champions, Lionel Messi Champion!""The match itself was a disappointing one, with Argentina the better side in a cagey first half that featured 21 fouls.However, Brazil came out more aggressively in the second period and as the time ticked on they threw more people forward - and at one point having five recognised strikers on the field.Richarlison had a goal chalked off for offside seven minutes into the second half and then forced Emiliano Martinez into a good stop two minutes later.But as Brazil poured forward gaps, opened up and Argentina missed two clear chances to score in the dying moments of the match.The victory was Argentina's 15th Copa America triumph and means they draw level with Uruguay as the all-time leading winners.""This is a very big title,"" said Argentine coach Lionel Scaloni. ""I hope that Argentines can enjoy it. The fans love the team unconditionally and I think they identify with this side that never drops its guard.""Their win extended their sequence of undefeated matches to 20 under Scaloni and handed Brazil their first competitive defeat since they lost to Belgium in the quarter-finals of the 2018 World Cup."

Beyond the nasty fallout from Brexit -- arguably the greatest crisis to befall the bloc since its creation -- and recovering from a global pandemic, the 27 member states are gearing up for a huge row over LGBT rights, the rule of law and the role both should play in the Union's future. Tensions have been bubbling for a while, but in recent days, two events have made it clear that the issue cannot be ignored any longer. Hungary, led by the right-wing populist Viktor Orban, brought into effect a new law that bans information which ""promotes"" homosexuality and gender change being used in schools. The government claims it is doing to so protect children, though critics believe that prohibiting access to such information stigmatizes LGBTQ people, putting them at risk of discrimination and violence.European Union urged to punish Hungary over law criticized as homophobic Read MoreOn Wednesday of this week, Members of the European Parliament presented a legal case for the EU Commission, the bloc's executive branch, to strip Hungary of its EU funding as it is not meeting its obligations as an EU member state. While the case makes no mention of Hungary's anti-LGBTQ laws, focusing instead on the country's assaults on judicial independence, among other things, the MEPs presenting the case made clear to CNN that the two are linked. Katalin Cseh, a Hungarian opposition MEP, explained that the report ""establishes the legal case"" for stripping funding from Orban's government via what is called the rule of law mechanism, ""based on his rampant corruption."" She adds that corruption is ""intimately linked to human rights abuses like the recent attack against the LGBTI community"" because ""an independent judiciary should be protecting LGBTI people's rights too.""Her German colleague, Daniel Freund, explains that the focus on the rule of law is part of a wider effort to create a cumulative pressure on Budapest. ""If we can cut their funding, which is the only language Orban really understands, for his assaults on the judiciary, then hopefully we can use it to build cumulative pressure for violations of the EU treaties in other areas."" The new law is part of a years-long erosion of rights for LGBTQ people. Luca Dudits from the Háttér Society, a Hungarian LGBTQ advocacy group, points to a long list of repressive actions, from banning same-sex marriage in 2011 to barring non-married couples from adopting last year. The reality of having an openly homophobic and transphobic government and little remaining independent media has, Dudits explains, created a dangerous ""echo chamber"" placing vulnerable people at serious risk of discrimination and violence. ""The invisibility means that there's no way that LGBTI people really feel that there is a safe environment to come out, and obviously this also impacts social acceptance. It also affects mental health, if you are constantly hearing that you are an immoral person who is a danger to children."" 'Hateful rhetoric' in the blocHungary is not the only EU nation currently under fire for its treatment of LGBT people. Poland's infamous LGBT-free zones, areas where opposition to LGBT ""ideology"" is symbolically written into law at state and local levels, have been criticized widely as being in violation of the EU's commitments to human rights and, in some cases, have seen applications for EU funding pulled. Karolina Gierdal, a lawyer for the Polish advocacy group Campaign Against Homophobia, told CNN that as long as ""politicians can get away with their hateful rhetoric and actions, they signal to citizens that ""harassing the LGBTQI community is not discrimination and that their homophobia or transphobia is justified and may be acted upon.""Critics in Poland would like to see more action from Brussels. Sylwia Spurek, Poland's former deputy to the ombudsman on equal treatment who is now an opposition MEP, believes that the current debate around the rule of law is too narrow ""because everybody is talking about, about independence of judiciary, about freedom of media, about a shrinking civic space."" An Equality Parade marched through Warsaw on June 19 -- after being canceled in 2020 due to Covid restrictions. She is trying to convince the Commission to see human rights as part of the rule of law. Her argument is that Article 2 of the EU treaty concerns respect ""for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities."" Spurek believes that violating this part of the treaty is clearly an infringement of the rule of law, which is in itself grounds for pulling EU funds from the Polish government.  The problems Poland and Hungary's opponents face are that not everyone agrees on the legal point, that the action that the Commission or EU Council (represented by the elected governments of the 27 member states) could actually take is politically limited, and that the wider consequences of unilateral action could create an even bigger mess. ""It's all very tense. Several of the more liberal member states are uncomfortable with asking their taxpayers to fund countries whose behavior they abhor,"" said one EU diplomat. Those member states want the Commission to act, ""because the divisions between the member states in the Council make any serious actions very hard, especially in areas where unanimous votes are required,"" the diplomat added. Normally, divisions in the Council are characterized by narrow national, often economic, self-interest. On the matter of LGBT rights, the fury from more liberal member states is palpable. At the last Council summit on June 24, Mark Rutte, the Dutch PM, openly said that Hungary ""has no place in the EU anymore,"" before the leaders had even met. In the closed-door session, Luxembourg's Prime Minister, Xavier Bettel, starkly warned Orban: ""My grandfather was Jewish, I'm gay and can live freely. And then I read this law. I know what happens when you turn people into a minority,"" according to a Luxembourg government official. And 17 member states pointedly signed a letter to the presidents of the EU institutions, reiterating their support for human rights as outlined in Article 2. Eastern Europe was once a world leader on gay rights. Then it ran out of scapegoatsFor its part, the Commission is concerned that any unilateral action could backfire politically. ""If the Commission starts saying it wants to keep money from these countries, they are able to say 'look, Brussels wants to hurt us and I am the best person to protect you,' strengthening their domestic political grip,"" a second EU official explained.From the perspective of Hungary and Poland and their allies around Europe, they are simply showing ""respect for Europe's Judeo-Christian heritage."" According to a statement that was co-signed by the governments of Hungary and Poland and supportive parties elsewhere, the EU is becoming ""a tool of radical forces"" that want to erase national identity and replace it with ""a European Superstate."" Their statement claimed they wanted to ensure that their traditional values are present as the debate over Europe's future enters a new phase. This is where things get very messy and somewhat existential for the bloc. The fight for the heart of EuropeThe words ""future of Europe"" get thrown around a lot by people in Brussels, but usually by people who are largely supportive of the EU becoming institutionally stronger and more centralized. The fact the likes of Poland, Hungary and their supporters, including France's far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen and Italy's populist firebrand Matteo Salvini, put out a statement on their vision for the future of the EU is chilling for Europhiles. Those who love Europe generally accept it needs to evolve to survive.""Right now, the union is not fit for the challenges of the future. We can either go into the direction of a stronger Europe with more powers, or a weaker Europe, which is fragmented. I firmly believe that [latter version of] Europe has no future,"" says Cseh.Spurek agrees that ""if the Commission, the Council, has no determination to protect these values, there is no future of the European Union.""The pandemic is stirring deep resentments in Europe. They may not be quick to healSo many of the problems facing Europe had been masked by the unity Brexit afforded the 27 as they confronted a single foe, despite the challenges that posed. With the UK gone, the fight for the heart of the European project is well underway. There is no easy answer. ""The EU needs to simultaneously be a shared set of values but also flexible enough to accommodate every perspective on that dividing line,"" says Ronan McCrea, professor of European law at University College London. That dividing line is often characterized seen as East versus West, old members versus new. Many of those member states who joined as former Soviet satellites had to jump through hoops to prove they were up to becoming part of the liberal, rule-based West. But as McCrea puts it, ""the EU is a bit like a nightclub with ferocious bouncers on the door but weak internal security. Once you've passed the accession process and are in, you can break the rules with much less serious consequences.""The EU has been historically good at fudging issues to avoid catastrophe. However, most of its crises have been economic and overtly political. This degree of conflict over rival values and culture is fairly new territory. And what's panicking so many in Brussels is that, unlike an economic or political crisis, they sincerely have no idea how this ultimately plays out."

But while the accomplishments of the ""Courageous Classes of 2001"" are worth celebrating, the date they are commemorating is not. Over the course of 12 weeks in 2001, Burns and the other pupils at north Belfast's Holy Cross Girls' primary were subjected to a barrage of abuse from a group of loyalist Protestants blocking their path to the school gate.The unrest, reported on globally at the time, began during the last week of the summer term, before violence exploded on the children's return to school in the fall. An angry mob threw urine-filled balloons and, eventually, a pipe bomb as children -- some as young as five -- ran the gauntlet each day to get to class.It had been three years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, the landmark peace accord also called the Belfast Agreement that marked an end to the decades-long conflict known as the Troubles, but sectarian tensions were still rife in Belfast's Ardoyne neighborhood.Two decades later, violence is still never far from the surface in Northern Ireland, with the pain of the past still driving discontent.Read MoreAs July 12 nears, and loyalist Protestants prepare the annual celebration of King William of Orange's victory over Catholic King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 with marches and bonfires, there are fears that unrest could spill onto the streets, as they did briefly earlier this year.The catalyst for the chaos at Holy Cross in 2001 is still disputed: Protestant loyalists, who identify as British, say Catholic nationalists, who identify as Irish, had knocked a loyalist off a ladder as he was hanging a flag ahead of the traditional loyalist marching season. Catholic nationalists say it was an attack on their presence in a majority-Protestant area.But underscoring all of this was a bigger issue: While the Catholic Ardoyne was thriving, a Protestant exodus from the neighboring enclave of Glenbryn was intensifying, with claims of intimidation leveled at nationalist republicans.The Holy Cross dispute showed just how fragile the new peace was. Its continuing impact has added to a collective trauma that serves as a unifying thread across Northern Ireland.The Holy Cross Girls Primary School, in north Belfast's Ardoyne area, became a flashpoint for sectarian violence in 2001.While others have struggled to reconcile the past, years of therapy and cross-community engagement have helped some of the Holy Cross schoolgirls to move forward.""You don't ever really overcome it, you just learn how to live with it,"" explains Burns, who was five when the protests erupted outside her school.  She and her older sister, a fellow pupil, experienced night terrors as a result of the violence, but despite everything, Burns says the school ""was a safe place"" -- life went on as normal once they were inside. Burns, a cross-community worker, says her experiences at Holy Cross have shaped her life since -- in a largely positive way: ""I've carried my experience with me the whole time, which has allowed me to do the work that I am doing now."" For Gemma McCabe, another former Holy Cross student, memories of the dispute are painful, but she says the incident hasn't defined her outlook.""I was brought up not to let that get at you or ... bring you down,"" she tells CNN. ""I know it was a traumatic time, but to me it was only a short time of my life."" Saying this, McCabe looks to her father Gerry, who lived through the worst of the Troubles, when sectarian violence between the late 1960s and 1998 left more than 3,500 people dead.Gerry McCabe says he and his wife tried to shield their daughter, who was eight at the time, from what was going on. ""Truth be told we probably would have simplified it. Beyond simplifying, we would have ... put frills on it.""Gerry McCabe (right), a former Sinn Féin councilor for Ardoyne, says those still looking to stir up chaos are living in the past. For his daughter, Gemma (left, who did not wish to have her face shown), the past is the past.
McCabe understands why her parents tried to protect her. ""As you get older, you learn the politics of Northern Ireland and ... you would never have understood that as a kid anyway. So what way do you tell a kid? You don't,"" she says.Burns says that her parents shunned the ""us and them"" narrative, and encouraged her to engage in opportunities that would benefit her community as a whole. ""Yes, ok we live in an area that seems to be deprived, that seems to be on the news for bad stuff --  but realistically there are a lot of good people and opportunities and all you need to do is get involved,"" she says.After intense negotiations across sectarian, international and religious lines  -- which Gerry McCabe took part in, as the head of a parents' group -- the protesters agreed to suspend their campaign in November 2001.For him, what happened at Holy Cross was an abomination, but it followed a familiar trajectory: ""It's two steps forward, 10 steps back,"" he explains. ""And that's the type of society that we have been living in for all my life.""In the 20 years since the Holy Cross dispute, the social fabric of Northern Ireland has changed drastically, with a growing section of society abandoning the traditional markers of British or Irish, Protestant or Catholic identity.Despite that change, the same sections of society continue to feel left behind.Deprivation, poor educational outcomes and a lack of jobs have long plagued working-class communities across Northern Ireland.Youths gather near a ""peace wall"" in north Belfast's Alexandra Park. The peace wall, also referred to as a ""separation barrier,"" is one of dozens of structures erected to separate predominantly republican and nationalist neighborhoods. 
But for loyalists, that inter-generational sense of hopelessness has been compounded by a series of external factors that some fear could signal a splintering of the United Kingdom itself.Some of that insecurity has arisen as a result of Brexit.  The Northern Ireland protocol, part of the deal which saw the UK leave the European Union, creates a customs border in the Irish Sea in order to avoid having one on the island of Ireland. The problem for unionists is that it keeps Northern Ireland in the same customs union as the Republic of Ireland (an EU member state) while adding checks on goods from the rest of the UK, of which Northern Ireland remains a part. They feel betrayed by the agreement and the customs alignment to the Republic of Ireland, saying the protocol puts them in different standing to England, Wales and Scotland -- the other three nations that make up the kingdom.Adding to unionists' concerns is the growing popularity of Sinn Féin. This all-Ireland nationalist republican party, whose ambition is to see a united Ireland, is projected to become the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly for the first time in its history next year, while it has been gaining ground over the border in the Republic of Ireland. A mural of the republican icon and hunger striker Bobby Sands is painted on the Sinn Féin office in west Belfast.Meanwhile, the unionist political landscape is riven with fractures. The most powerful unionist party, the DUP, has had three leaders in the past three months, with support for the party declining dramatically. Changing demographics also play a part: While Protestants once outnumbered Catholics two to one in Northern Ireland, the 2021 census is tipped to show a Catholic majority in the region for the first time, when it is released next year. ""All of these things ... conspire to make people very fearful, because they assume maybe this is the endgame for the union,"" says Gareth Mulvenna, an expert on the Troubles and loyalist paramilitaries. ""Loyalism and unionism are always reactive and on the defensive mode, but now, unionism is having to react to different forces outside of its control,"" he says.This spring, as Northern Ireland prepared to celebrate the centenary of its foundation, those tensions reached fever pitch. Rioters in primarily loyalist neighborhoods took to the streets, hurling petrol bombs at police officers and setting a bus alight, propelling the region, once again, back into the international headlines. When loyalist and nationalist communities clashed along a so-called peace line -- a gated wall separating unionist and nationalist areas -- the region braced for sustained violence. But that disorder did not come.Now, as the climax of the loyalist marching season draws near, those closest to Northern Ireland's legacy of violence are once again appealing for calm.A girl peruses an array of marching season paraphernalia on the Shankill Road in west Belfast. Billy Hutchinson, a Progressive Unionist Party councillor, says there is no appetite for a return to the dark days of the past. Hutchinson is a former loyalist paramilitary who spent 15 years in prison for his involvement in the sectarian murders of two Catholic half-brothers during the Troubles. He doesn't think Northern Ireland's society has slipped back to where it was during the Holy Cross protests -- but warns that it ""doesn't take much to light the fire.""Hutchinson was one of those who tried to diffuse tensions at Holy Cross in 2001. In his 2020 book about his life, he wrote that while the loyalists' grievances were legitimate, they were also ""totally counterproductive -- and portrayed loyalism as backward and nasty in the eyes of the world.""But the root of those grievances has not changed, he said -- many loyalists feel ""under siege"" today. Young loyalists in particular have ""no stake in society,"" he said. ""What we need to do is to build confidence in this community that they're still British. And they will be until, you know, if some sort of poll says we aren't,"" he said.Progressive Unionist Party leader Billy Hutchinson: ""I've seen the trouble starting when we didn't have troubles. They start for a reason, and the same thing can happen again. So people need to be very careful.""Hutchinson is talking about a potential border poll on Irish unification -- something he sees as a bigger threat to unionism than the Brexit deal's Northern Ireland Protocol.  A clause in the 1998 peace accords says a referendum on Irish unification should be held if it appears likely that the majority of voters would back it. Consent for a united Ireland would need to be given concurrently in both Northern Ireland and in the Republic, according to the Good Friday Agreement.While Hutchinson doesn't believe that a united Ireland is inevitable he, like many unionists who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK, feels it is an attack on his identity. ""There's a cultural war on,"" he says.Conor Maskey, a Sinn Fein councillor for Belfast's Castle electoral area, one of the most mixed parts of the city, understands that unionists find talk of a border poll ""unsettling,"" but feels it's his responsibility to explain ""how that's not going to move us in a negative direction, but a positive one.""Plus, it's ""the unionists' responsibility to convince someone like me that we shouldn't have a border poll,"" he said, adding that if one were held and the vote favored a united Ireland, unionists' rights would be protected.But in these uncertain times, many loyalists feel those rights are already being eroded, pointing to the removal of a number of traditional bonfires erected ahead of July 12. A young loyalist sporting red, white, and blue braids  -- the colors of the Union Flag -- attends a parade on the Shankill Road in west Belfast.  Emma Shaw, a loyalist activist and MA student in educational policy, says that part of the problem stems from general perceptions about loyalism. ""The word loyalist is always portrayed in a really negative light,"" she says. ""And that's really frustrating for me, because it's always like, 'loyalists, or knuckle draggers, they're in the past, they don't want society to move forward.' And that actually couldn't be further from the truth, especially in regards to the women."" Shaw says the community has worked with local authorities for years to ensure the safety of the bonfires, including on how to make them more environmentally friendly. ""But as council changes from a unionist, to a more nationalist focus, it just feels like we're being told to give, give, give, and we don't really have anything left to give,"" she said.Loyalist Emma Shaw, in east Belfast's CS Lewis Square. While Shaw says bonfires are an integral part of her community's culture, she knows they can also be used as a form of political protest, with the burning of election posters, effigies and flags a common sight.Loyalist activist Joel Keys said he doesn't like to see posters and flags burn on the fires -- but adds that if there was one image he would place there it would be that of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, ""because he's betrayed us."" Keys understands that his political opponents want to unite Ireland: ""I know they're (Sinn Féin) not in it for my interests, they're very open about that fact and about what they care about.""""But Boris pretends to be on our side, he pretends to be one of our friends. And you can only be betrayed by people who claim to be your friends; you can only be betrayed by people who claim to be on your side,"" he says.The 19-year-old feels his community is under threat. He's made it his mission to encourage more young loyalists to get involved in politics, explaining to them that ""representatives are people that work for you.""""I think lots of people need to get it into their heads that change is not incredibly far out of their reach,"" he says. 

""Boris pretends to be on our side... you can only be betrayed by people who claim to be on your side.""
Joel Keys, loyalist activist

But that change might not necessarily be along traditional orange (Protestant) and green (Catholic) demarcations.A bonfire in central Belfast is prepared ahead of the Eleventh Night, a loyalist tradition to commemorate the victory of Protestant King William of Orange over Catholic King James II in 1690. The bonfires are upheld as an important part of unionist culture, but are viewed as provocative to some members of the Catholic nationalist community. In a recent Northern Ireland Youth Forum (NIYF) report, mental health was the biggest concern for young people, rather than any other social or political issue.When it came to questions of religion, culture and identity, nearly half (45%) of those asked identified as Northern Irish; an overwhelming majority (82%) of respondents said an individual's religious background had no impact on how they would feel about them. NIYF youth workers Martin Kelly and Lauren McAreavey say the ""us and them"" narrative still exists in some communities, but that young people are moving away from it, breaking down barriers to work closely together on the issues that are right on their doorstep.""There's too many people that don't want times to go back to the way that it was than people who want it to,"" former Holy Cross student McCabe, whose partner is Protestant, said.For her, the past is simple: ""You remember it -- but you move on."""

The 34-year-old started the match with a double fault before surviving a break-point in his first service game. Berrettini, bidding to become the first Italian winner of a Wimbledon singles title, looked to rely on his powerful serve and booming forehand to settle himself into the match but was broken by Djokovic in his second service game. The Italian then began struggling for form, missing a couple of easy shots, but discovered his rhythm just in time, breaking back against Djokovic as he was serving for the set.The mini-victory seemed to give Berrettini a boost and momentum swung in his favor as the crowd got behind the underdog. The opening set went into a nail-biting tie-break which Berrettini sealed with an emphatic ace. It was clear Djokovic needed to up his game, and that's exactly what he did in the second set, breaking the Italian's serve twice in his first two attempts. Berrettini didn't go away, though, once again breaking back when Djokovic was serving for the set, but the Serbian dug deep to level the match. The third set was more like the final many had expected, with both men producing wonderful tennis much to the delight of the packed stands on Centre Court.

It showed his intense reaction to each penalty Argentina scored, while he was also the first to console Rodrigo De Paul after his miss.READ: Messi scores two and assists once while becoming Argentina's most capped playerArgentina's goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez and Argentina's Lionel Messi embraces Emiliano Martinez after the goalkeeper's shootout heroics.However, it was his reaction to Yerry Mina's miss that generated the biggest reaction on social media. The Colombia defender has become known for his somewhat over the top celebrations after scoring in shootouts and after his penalty was saved by Emiliano Martinez, Messi could be seen shouting ""dance now"" at Mina during his entire walk back to the center circle.Messi exuberance was a stark contrast to the last time he featured in a penalty shootout for Argentina. After missing his penalty in the final against Chile in 2016, Messi was doubled over on the turf and appeared to be close to vomiting.Martinez was unquestionably the hero of Wednesday's tie, saving three of Colombia's penalties and the Aston Villa goalkeeper was mobbed by Messi and his teammates.Messi celebrates after scoring his penalty during the shootout against Colombia.Saturday's showpiece will be the first time since 2007 that Brazil and Argentina have faced off in a Copa America final, incidentally Messi's first with the national team.There will be 5,500 spectators at the iconic Maracana stadium to watch it, the first time fans will be able to attend matches this tournament. The attendees will have to show a negative Covid-19 PCR test, wear masks, and maintain two meters distance from while inside.Brazil will be hoping for a repeat of that comfortable 3-0 win and go into this match as the favorite.Under head coach Tite, Brazil is a long way from playing the 'beautiful football' of old, but this side is pragmatic and dogged, a style that has brought considerable success over the past five years.That culminated in victory at the 2019 Copa America, the country's first piece of major silverware since 2007.Standing in Messi's way in the final is old friend Neymar.Brazil has never quite clicked into top gear during this tournament, but has found success built on a stingy defense; the team has conceded just two goals all tournament and none so far in the knockout stages.Even when down to 10 men for the entire second half in the quarterfinal against Chile, Brazil never looked like conceding a goal.Neymar's legacy with the Brazilian national team is already guaranteed to be one of glory. Not only has he led the team to Olympic and Copa America glory on home soil, he will more than likely finish his career's as Brazil's greatest ever goalscorer, currently just nine goals behind Pele.Should Messi lead Argentina to glory, however, it would certainly alter his legacy entirely.Rodrigo Pedroso contributed reporting."

Barty is the first Australian woman to win the singles title since her idol Evonne Goolagong Cawley won it in 1980. Pliskova, who was competing in just her second grand slam final, took too long to settle into the match and was made to pay for her early form despite improving in the more competitive second and third sets. ""I have to genuinely thank every single person in this stadium. You have made my dream so special, thank you so much,"" Barty said during her on-court interview. Read More""It was an exceptional match right from the start, I knew I had to bring my very best level. I was really proud of myself with the way I was able to reset and just keep going."" Ashleigh Barty kisses the Venus Rosewater Dish trophy after winning her first Wimbledon single's title. For the first time since 1977, both women were making their debut appearance in a Wimbledon final but one dealt with it much better than the other. Pliskova started the match very nervous and Barty, with the superior experience, never really had to shift out of first gear during the opening exchanges. The Czech player's serve is usually her most potent weapon but even that abandoned her in the early stages -- it took her until the third game before she even won a point.The first set was over in a blur and there was seemingly no change at the start of the second with Barty going a break up once again. But, with the match seemingly sliding away from Pliskova, she finally found her rhythm and broke back to make it 3-3. It was like a different player had taken to the court, with Pliskova slamming aces and pushing Barty to her limits. But the Australian looked equal to her opponent's efforts and had the chance to serve for the championship, only to scupper the opportunity and lose in the resulting tie-break. The decisive set was more like the final that many had expected, with both players demanding the very best out of each other. Barty's class eventually shone through as she recovered from a disappointing second set to win the decider in more comfortable fashion. ""She was playing an incredible tournament and incredible match today,"" an emotional Pliskova said during her on-court interview. ""It wasn't easy to close the second set, I was fighting to make it difficult for her but I think she really played very well so congratulations to her.""After a nervous start, Karolina Pliskova improved as the match went on. It's been an incredible journey to her first Wimbledon title for Barty. Having enjoyed a stellar junior career, she took a break from tennis in 2014, later saying that the sport had become ""robotic"" and that she was a ""victim of my own success.""She turned to cricket and earned a contract as an all-rounder with Brisbane Heat back in Australia, before returning to tennis in 2016.She went on to win her first grand slam at the French Open in 2019 before taking another break from the sport during the Covid-19 pandemic."

The world No.1 progressed in straight sets -- 7-6 (7-3) 7-5 7-5 -- but the final result doesn't reflect how well Shapovalov played in what was his first Grand Slam semifinal. Meanwhile, Djokovic was playing in his 41st Grand Slam semifinal and showed just how important experience and mentality is at this stage of the tournament. He will now look to claim a record-equaling 20th major title in Sunday's final, which would bring him alongside Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer for the most men's Grand Slam titles.

Djokovic digs deep Despite his young opponent showing real promise throughout the match, Djokovic dug deep and was able to turn it on when it really mattered, leaving Shapovalov a frustrated figure on court at times. A tiebreak was needed to separate the two men during a nail-biting first set after Shapovalov failed to serve it out. The Canadian wasted yet more chances in the second, with Djokovic surviving five break points before taking his one and only chance to break the Canadian and take the set. Shapovalov was clearly frustrated as both players prepared for the third, with the 22-year-old remonstrating with the chair umpire over a controversial call which had handed Djokovic the second set. Fired up, Shapovalov started the third set impressively and was cheered on by those watching on Center Court. But it was a familiar story in the end. On big points, Djokovic simply found a new level -- a trait which has seen him win a career total of 19 Grand Slam titles -- and broke Shapovalov's final service game.Shapovalov was in tears as he left the court while Djokovic, clearly pumped up, praised his opponent for an extraordinary performance. Shapovalov cut a frustrated figure at time during the match. 'He's a great player'""I don't think the scoreline says enough about the match,"" Djokovic added.""He was serving for the first set and he was probably the better player for most of the second set, he had many chances.

""Really ... I need a couple of hours to understand what happened. I played a great match, I enjoyed the crowd, my family and whole team are there. I think I never dreamed about this because it was too much for a dream. I am so happy.""After the third set I was feeling I deserved to win it, but lost it. I said: 'It doesn't matter,' I was feeling the stronger player and that's what I said to myself and eventually it paid off.""So far it is the best tennis day of my life, but hopefully Sunday will be even better. I feel kind of chills but I am doing it, so I have to believe it.""No nervesHubert Hurkacz was unable to come back from two sets down.The first set started evenly and there was certainly no sign of one player's domination that was to come.Hurkacz managed to hold magnificently from 0-40 down in only his second service game and, at the time, it felt like it could be a significant moment.However, Hurkacz was broken two service games later, with Berrettini punctuating the break with a stunning forehand on the run while chasing down his opponent's smash, surely one of the shots of the tournament so far.Berrettini won all remaining games in the set and Hurkacz, incredibly, wouldn't win another for almost an hour.Whether it was due to Berrettini stepping it up a level or Hurkacz struggling under the pressure of the occasion -- most likely a combination of the two -- the second set was over in the blink of an eye.When Berrettini rushed to a 5-0 lead, it meant he had won nine consecutive games and this semifinal was in danger of getting away from Hurkacz faster that one of Berrettini's crunching serves.The crowd tried desperately to lift Hurkacz, cheering wildly whenever he won a point. He attempted to lift himself, too, gently clenching his fist whenever he showed brief flashes of the skill that had brought him to this stage of the tournament.Matteo Berrettini's serve was unstoppable at times in Friday's semifinal.Despite that, he was unable to win even a single game in the second set as Berrettini stormed to a 2-0 lead.The odds were now stacked heavily against Hurkacz, who had only once come back from two sets down to win a best of five set match in his career.Fortunately for the crowd on Center Court, the third set was considerably more competitive than the second. When Hurkacz won his first service game to level the third at 1-1 it broke a run of 11 straight games for Berrettini and drew a huge roar of appreciation from the capacity 15,000 crowd.Huge credit must go to Hurkacz for his improvement in the third set -- certainly better players have wilted in the past when faced with such a scoreboard -- and by the time it reached a tie break, you sensed the momentum had all of sudden swung towards the Pole.Berrettini began to show the first signs of frustrations when Hurkacz hit an overhead winner after a weak lob attempt, extending his hand in bewilderment towards his box.Hurkacz opened up a 4-0 lead in the tie break and comfortably saw it out 7-3, all the while suddenly playing his best tennis of the contest so far.However, that momentum didn't carry over into the fourth set as Berrettini -- who took at tactical bathroom break at the end of the third -- broke Hurkacz in his opening service game.Hubert Hurkacz rallied well to win the third.From there, Hurkacz never looked like getting level.As he walked out to serve for the match, Berrettini would have drawn strength from the knowledge that he had won an incredible 150 of his 157 service games on grass so far this year. The 158th would surely be the nerviest yet, not least after Berrettini hit his first double fault of the match on the game's first point.However, it proved to be nothing more than a minor blip as the Italian found his aim again to finally get past his gritty opponent.The Italian will now play either Novak Djokovic or Denis Shapovalov, who play later on Friday, in Sunday's showpiece final."

They don't just represent us, they also need to reflect the nation's emotions.Euphoric England football fans celebrate in the streets of central London after the country reached the finals. The Queen has mastered the art of expressing the national mood, even when she appears to be expressing no emotion at all. That's how she has connected with her subjects and remained relevant throughout her 69-year reign, despite having very little in common with them in reality.Princes Charles and William will need to do the same when they take the throne if their reigns are to be as successful. The easy part of being King will be the formal duties that come with being head of state.

It's his chance to be associated with that.If he can look like the nation feels, it will be his biggest opportunity to date to connect with his future subjects and show he's there for them like his grandmother has always been. This isn't just about a royal football fan turning up to watch a game, it's about future-proofing the British monarchy and securing its place at the heart of the nation.ROYAL TEA BREAKWith football fever gripping England thanks to their stellar performance in the Euros, even Prince Charles is getting in on the action. He invited the band of the Coldstream Guards regiment to play instrumental versions of two fan favorite anthems in the garden of his London residence on Tuesday. The band played the song ""Three Lions,"" with its ubiquitous ""It's coming home"" lyric, along with Neil Diamond's 1969 hit ""Sweet Caroline,"" at Clarence House in support of the men's team, who will take on Italy in Sunday's final.

A sentencing hearing will begin on September 29.Everard, 33, went missing on March 3 after leaving a friend's house in Clapham, south London, in the early evening.

Boris Johnson's government has botched its response""Today is not the day for hearing the facts about what happened to Sarah.

A review process found that he had passed vetting processes and that no information had been available then that would have changed this, it said.Couzens ceased to be paid as a police officer as soon as he entered his previous guilty pleas, the statement added. ""This was as soon as legally possible.

","europe, A hate-filled attack made a grandson of Holocaust survivors understand their experience a little more. But he decided to buck their advice  - CNN",A hate-filled attack made a grandson of Holocaust survivors understand their experience a little more. But he decided to buck their advice ,"Vienna, Austria (CNN)Elie Rosen had never really listened as a child when his grandparents told him and his cousins to keep their heads down. He knew they had survived the Holocaust but he believed the world's vow of ""never again"" and saw no reason for his generation of European Jews to fear. That changed when a man wielding a baseball bat came after him in front of his synagogue in Graz, Austria. The building had been repeatedly vandalized and while Rosen managed to reach his car and escape unharmed physically, he was shaken to his core. ""After the attack, those warnings of my grandparents had kind of a flashback,"" he told CNN. ""This made me very, very sorry and brought tears to my heart and to my face,"" he said. Elie Rosen, photographed in Vienna's  Stadttempel synagogue, decided to change his approach after he was attacked.""Being physically attacked is a different dimension than being verbally attacked, which I am used to because anti-Semitism has risen in the last year.""Violence and oppression against Jews and their faith has been a constant in Europe, but recorded incidents of anti-Semitism have been on an alarming rise, partly fueled by lockdowns to stop the spread of coronavirus. Read MoreIn Rosen's home of Austria, there has been the highest number of anti-Semitic attacks since the country started recording them 19 years ago. Benjamin Nägele, secretary general of Jewish Communities Austria, said its figures showed a 6.4% rise in reports of anti-Semitic incidents in 2020, even though he says many people do not report every time someone uses a slur against them. Men worship at the Stadttempel synagogue in Vienna. There are about 15,000 Jews in Austria, down from an estimated 220,000 before the rise of Hitler.""We've seen a worrying trend not only in Austria, but throughout Europe when it comes to anti-Semitism, he said. Nägele said the verbal aggression comes first because it is so easy, especially online. ""You can do it anonymously. You can do it a lot of times without fearing any prosecution,"" he said. ""And then you get encouraged to do it more, to be more aggressive, to actually add insult to injury and, at some point, get so radicalized that you then transfer it to the real world.""Coronavirus conspiracies Katharina von Schnurbein, the European Commission's anti-Semitism coordinator, said the issues were ancient but there had been a new impetus to some of the hate. ""Anti-Semitic conspiracy myths have been there for centuries,"" she told CNN. ""Whenever there is a pandemic, they have come to the fore again. What we see is that, for example, during Covid, anti-Semitic tropes and conspiracy myths have increased significantly on social platforms.""As people marched in protest against strict lockdowns imposed by their leaders, the German RIAS organization, which tracks anti-Semitism, noted Jewish tropes among the placards. At one event in Bavaria, RIAS said, demonstrators held up a photomontage of people being forcibly vaccinated by people wearing uniforms bearing what looked like a Star of David and the word ""Zion."" Demonstrations against pandemic lockdowns and this year's violence between Israel and Hamas have seen anti-Semitic protest signs, the German watchdog RIAS says.In another case in Berlin, a man appeared to accept the false conspiracy theory that the pandemic was caused by Jews, shouting at two identifiably Jewish pedestrians, ""Are you not ashamed, what you did, you Jews?"" RIAS reported. More than a quarter of the anti-Semitic incidents documented were related directly to the coronavirus, the group said in its annual report. The violence between Israel and Hamas in May this year again fueled anti-Jewish sentiment in Germany, RIAS found, with all Jews being targeted for the actions of Israel's government and military. ""Stop doing what Hitler did to you,"" read one sign in English held up during a pro-Palestinian march in Berlin, the group said. Benjamin Ward, deputy director in Human Rights Watch's Europe division, agreed that anti-Semitism was often cyclical and propelled by events in the Middle East. But he added, ""If we look more broadly at the phenomenon of anti-Semitism in Europe, we see that it's much older and also much wider. it's really a European issue.""Jewish cemeteries and memorials, like this one in Berlin, are often desecrated, including with Nazi symbols.Across Europe, anti-Semitic attacks have been rising for years. France has seen numerous attacks -- in 2012, three children and a teacher were gunned down at a Jewish school in Toulouse; in 2015, four people were shot dead and others held hostage in a kosher supermarket in Paris; in 2018, an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor was killed when she was stabbed 11 times and then had her Paris apartment set on fire. Jewish cemeteries from France to Poland are regularly desecrated, and nine out of 10 European Jews believe that anti-Semitism is on the rise, according to a survey by the European Commission.Different ways to deal with hate In Brussels, Rabbi Albert Guigui is one of those responding by trying to hide his very identity, to look less Jewish. ""Of course, I wear a yarmulke at home, but outside I prefer to cover my head less conspicuously,"" he said, talking of the baseball cap he dons most days. ""It's not healthy to live in an atmosphere of fear and where you feel hunted.""As those with living memory of the Holocaust pass away, Guigui worries more hate will come. Not just neo-Nazis with tiki torches: Why Jewish students say they also fear cloaked anti-Semitism""There is concern precisely because there is no longer that barrier of memory,"" he said. ""Before, people couldn't openly express their anti-Semitism because the memory of the Holocaust was there to remind people where such words lead. Now there's been a liberation of the very speech that generates acts.""Back in Austria, Karoline Edtstadler, the country's minister for the EU, said the government was worried because although it was trying to tackle the upsurge in anti-Jewish hate, the numbers of incidents online and in real life kept rising. ""The positive thing, of course, is we have to foster Jewish life,"" she said. That's the new tactic of Rosen, who's bucking the advice of his grandparents and choosing to stand tall as a member of Austria's Jewish community, that now stands at about 15,000 people, a fraction of the 220,000 Jews estimated to have lived in Austria before the rise of Hitler. He says his grandparents' approach of keeping a low profile after the Holocaust, or Shoah, was understandable but misguided, and it was time to show and introduce others to Jewish life and traditions.""The post-Shoah society of Jews often thought that being silent, not being too loud, would lead to a higher acceptance of Jews in the main society,"" he explained, before saying that clearly did not work. ""I will tell my son or young Jewish people to proud of being Jewish and not to be silent.""Correction: In a previous version of this story, a photo caption misidentified the memorial to a Berlin synagogue looted in the Nazi era.Journalist Adam Berry contributed to this story."

That too was played in front of a packed Wembley Stadium but the tie ended in very different circumstances. Southgate was the man to miss the decisive penalty that night but, fast forward 25 years, and the 50-year-old has guided his country into its first European Championship final. ""I'm so proud of the players,"" Southgate told the UEFA website. ""It was an incredible occasion to be a part of. The fans were incredible all night.""England will now face Italy in the final after the Azzurri beat Spain on penalties Tuesday. Whilst the Italian side has looked imperious during Euro 2020, England will hope the home support at Wembley can inspire it to a historic victory on Sunday.READ: Italy wins dramatic penalty shootout against Spain to reach Euro 2020 finalMikkel Damsgaard gave his side the lead with a wonderful freekick. Crowds pack out Wembley The UK government allowed 60,000 fans to pack into Wembley Stadium for the semifinals, and those lucky enough to get their hands on tickets for Wednesday's match experienced an atmosphere like no other.England fans were unsurprisingly in the majority, singing and dancing their way down Wembley Way -- the famous road that leads to the ground -- before creating a party atmosphere inside the stadium as the sound of ""Sweet Caroline"" swirled around the cavernous venue.If fans of the Denmark team were in the minority, they certainly made their presence noticeable, with one end of the stadium littered with Danish flags.A wall of noise and a sense of nervousness and anticipation greeted as the players made their way out of the tunnel. After being locked down amid Covid-19 restrictions, it felt like one huge outpouring of emotion, reverberating through Wembley.""The whole feel good factor is about to burst with pure joy,"" one England fan told CNN as he walked to the stadium with his son.""I think everybody has just had this pent up emotion over this last year. It's a time when the end is in sight ... I think we are on that crest of the wave that I hope never breaks.""In those opening minutes England, in particular, looked inspired by that support.England equalised after Simon Kjaer turned the ball into his own net. Extra-timeAfter a manic start, the game settled down with Denmark sitting back and England doing most of the attacking. Sterling had a couple of half chances as the home support roared on the men in white. All of England's good early work was almost undone by a moment of madness from goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.After a routine save and under no pressure at all, his weak throw was easily intercepted but Denmark just couldn't work a space to shoot into what would have been an empty net.After that, the Danes grew into the game and took the lead through a magical Damsgaard free-kick on the half-hour mark. The set-piece was near perfect, whipped over the wall and giving Pickford no chance of saving it. The goal, the first England has conceded in this tournament, quieted the crowd -- but only temporarily.England was galvanized and moments after Sterling was denied an equalizer by a wonderful save from Schmeichel, Bukayo Saka's cross was accidentally turned in by defender Kjaer. In truth, Sterling was waiting for a tap-in had Kjaer not deflected the ball into the net.The second half started like the first with England on the hunt for a goal. Harry Maguire almost found the net with a header but Schmeichel was there yet again to push the effort to safety. Clear cut-chances were then few and far between as nerves seemed to take over in that second period, with extra-time needed to separate the sides. The English pressure only intensified after the break as it continued knocking at the red wall of defenders. Kane had an effort well saved before Jack Grealish's shot stung the keeper's palms. Then came the pivotal moment when Sterling went down under pressure in the box. Contact was minimal but enough, according to the referee. Kane, usually so assured from the spot, had his first attempt saved but sent a country into delirium as he stabbed home the rebound. ""Unbelievable -- what a game though, credit to Denmark,"" Kane told the UEFA website. ""We dug deep and we got there when it mattered. We reacted really well. We're in a final at home, what a feeling.""READ: Coldstream Guards play England football anthems on Prince Charles' lawnKasper Schmeichel made some impressive saves to keep Denmark in the tie. Denmark creditFor Denmark, which won Euro 92, this has been an extraordinary tournament.The team, and nation, was shaken when its talisman Eriksen collapsed on the field during its opening group game against Finland.The power, strength and resilience shown by the Danish players as Eriksen recovered will inevitably go on to define this tournament and both teams paid tribute to the playmaker before the semifinal.England captain Kane presented Denmark with an Eriksen shirt signed by all the players ahead of kick-off, a gesture applauded by both sets of fans.Then Southgate's side went about the task of trying to make history.

""For Naomi Osaka, she's part of the new generation of tennis stars and top-level athletes.

Her father was introduced to the game by his grandmother. He then got his wife playing, and it wasn't long before six-year-old Georgia was wielding her first golf club.She moved around, playing at different golf clubs and picking up new skills and experiences, which she believes has held her in good stead on her journey to becoming a professional. ""I ended up competing with girls and boys,"" the 20-year-old remembers. ""And eventually, I started to play the US Kids European Championship and then the US Kids World Championship, which I won at age 14, and then I played most of my junior golf, to be honest, in America.""So I spent a lot of my summers and winters abroad.

After making it through the pre-qualifier, she had a nervy wait on the final day of the actual event to earn her professional card. ""On the last hole, I had a par putt that would have put me on the knife's edge,"" she remembers. ""I made that final putt, and then it was kind of a waiting game to see whether I was going to make the cut or not.

""My main concern was playing the best I could,"" said Oboh as she reflected on the issue of diversity in golf. ""I've been to countries all over the world. But I don't try and let things like the color of my skin or my gender stop me from getting to where I need to or want to be.""While golf is part of the culture in many corners of the world, in Africa -- outside of South Africa -- it's still a sport that is new to the continent.South Africa has produced successful talents such as major winners Ernie Els, Gary Player, Retief Goosen, Charl Schwartzel and Louis Oostuizen on the men's side and Sally Little on the women's side. But due to a lack of ""investment and development"" at the junior levels of golf, other African countries have not been able to produce golfers of the same caliber. Oboh prepares to play during the 54th Junior Orange Bowl International Golf Championship.Oboh had the choice of representing the United Kingdom but chose Nigeria instead due to its connection to her heritage. She says her home course is the Ikoyi Club 1938 in Lagos, the commercial capital of Nigeria, and has won several awards in the country. She even won her first pro tournament in her professional debut at the Cote D'Ivoire Open.As the first Nigerian to play on the LET, Oboh is aware that her accomplishment of reaching the Tour is ""an achievement.""But she is hoping that she can be an example for others, rather than a flash in the pan for Nigerian golf.

Goolagong Cawley won Wimbledon single's titles in 1971 and 1980.Barty will face Karolina Pliskova in Saturday's showpiece final after the Czech defeated Aryna Sabalenka 5-7 6-4 6-4 in a Wimbledon thriller. Both players were appearing in their first Wimbledon semifinal, but there was no sign of any nerves as the two big hitters exchanged some ferocious rallies early on.Pliskova's serve had been looking imperious from the start, but a double fault when set point down at 30-40 surprisingly handed Sabalenka the opening set.Karolina Pliskova reached her second grand slam final.Always so calm and collected on court, Pliskova looked somewhat dejected as she trudged back to her chair, perhaps bewildered at how the set had all of a sudden got away from her.However, she certainly showed no signs of stewing on her disappointment and came out at the start of the second set on a mission.These two players are known for their powerful ground strokes but, as the quality of tennis continued to improve, both showed remarkable finesse around the net, Pliskova in particular showed deft touches to win incredible back-to-back rallies.The Czech finally got the break of serve her play merited in the fifth game of the second set and eventually managed to grind out the remainder of the set to level the match.Pliskova started the third set in much the same vein, breaking Sabalenka in her opening service game; the Belorussian, who is certainly more animated on court than her opponent, began to show some frustration for the first time. While Pliskova was serving for the match at 30-15, Sabalenka hit a ball towards the baseline that was called out by the line judge. Sabalenka chose not to challenge, which proved to be a mistake as the ball had actually caught the line.It gave Pliskova match point, which she converted at the first attempt with yet another ace to book her place in only her second grand slam final, where she will be hoping to go one better than she did in defeat to Kerber at the US Open in 2016."

In what was the first NBA Finals game in Phoenix since Jordan's Chicago Bulls won their third straight championship in 1993, Paul masterfully picked apart the Bucks defense. Afterward, Booker -- who is making his debut appearance in the playoffs this season -- praised the performance of his more experienced teammate. ""Every time he shoots it, we think it's going in,"" Booker told the media. ""Anybody that counted Chris Paul out,"" Booker added. ""You can't ever count any guy out that has done the things that he's done on the court.""So if I hear things like that, which I did, I take it as complete nonsense.

The ""Greek Freak"" hyperextended his knee in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Atlanta Hawks, missing the final two games of the series. The 26-year-old was cleared to appear in the series opener just hours before it began, and showed no signs of holding back in the opening stages, throwing himself about from the outset in the hopes of giving the Bucks a chance at victory.

Most evenings now, after logging off and closing her laptop, the 27-year-old unfolds her red Brompton bicycle, puts on her helmet and sets off down a suburban lane of terraced houses toward the city. ""I have been trying to practice, to go out every day and go a bit further and a bit further,"" said Grew, who works as a project manager for Britain's National Health Service, helping to organize London's Covid-19 vaccination rollout. These practice runs, which she describes as a kind of exposure therapy, are her way of mentally preparing for a return to the office in August or September -- the date has yet to be decided.""It's like training to run a marathon,"" she added.Read MoreBefore the pandemic, Grew would take the bus or the London Underground to work. But during lockdown her anxiety and agoraphobia, which she had kept at bay before, worsened. Leaving home, even to walk around her neighborhood, became daunting. The last time she went on the Tube -- now plastered with signs asking passengers to wear masks and maintain social distancing -- was in January 2020.""When I do go out, to places that are not close to my house, I instantly feel my heart beating harder, my chest feels tight,"" Grew said. ""I just have to get used to it.""As Britain looks to shake off the last of its coronavirus restrictions, despite an ongoing battle to contain a shape-shifting virus that continues to spin off new variants, many Britons such as Grew are finding the idea of returning to the office, taking crowded public transport or grabbing a pint with friends at a busy pub overwhelming, if not terrifying. ""A lot of my friends have sort of adjusted,"" said Grew. ""As soon as things were unlocking they were like, 'I can't wait to go clubbing, I can't wait to go to festivals or go away.' And I'm just like, 'Oh my God, I feel anxious just to go on the bus to my work.'""""I can't imagine getting on a plane and going to a different country, or even going to a club,"" said Grew, who has been seeing a therapist to work on coping mechanisms.England was originally set to mark ""freedom day"" -- when the final remnants of its lengthy lockdown would end -- on June 21, but the government hit pause until July 19 amid concerns over the Delta virus variant first identified in India, also known as B.1.617.2. The decision sparked an outcry from some corners of the population desperate to put the pandemic behind them. #ImDone trended on Twitter and British tabloids ran foreboding headlines about the future -- The Sun newspaper asked ""Will we ever be free?"" beneath the words ""Nation's torment"" on its front page.This week, Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson set out his plan to shift the focus away from legal requirements to personal responsibility for things such as social distancing and mask wearing. But he also issued a stark warning that ""this pandemic is far from over and it will certainly not be over by [July] 19th,"" explaining that Covid-19 cases are still rising across the United Kingdom. ""I don't want people to feel that this is, as it were, the moment to get demob-happy, this is the end of Covid ... it is very far from the end of dealing with this virus,"" he said.While many people have rushed joyfully back to restaurants, salons and shops since the first restrictions were loosened in mid-April, not everyone is relishing the move toward a full reopening.Diners on a terrace near London's Borough Market last month. Brits have been allowed to go for a meal outdoors or indoors with up to six people or as two households since mid-May.""We have been trained over the past 18 months that being around people and being out in the world is associated with a threat,"" said psychologist and author Emma Kavanagh. ""Our brain is now attuned to that, so of course it's going to trigger a stress response when we expose ourselves again.""Kavanagh began researching neurological responses to extreme environments last March, when the first lockdown in Britain began, after she tested positive for Covid-19 and found herself struggling with anxiety.""I was hysterical, I thought I couldn't survive this level of stress,"" she recalled. ""I couldn't concentrate. I was like everyone else, I was falling apart.""While suffering from long Covid and homeschooling her children, Kavanagh took to social media to share her research into burnout, brain fog and the other surreal symptoms now synonymous with pandemic life. Her Twitter threads quickly went viral; their subject matter is the focus of her latest book, How to be Broken, which offers insights into coping with sustained stress. For those who fear they may never be ready to return to normal -- or whatever ""new normal"" comes next -- Kavanagh offers one key piece of advice: Give it time. ""A significant number of people who are exposed to trauma don't just show resilience, they also show post-traumatic growth,"" she told CNN.Still, some psychologists predict that the heightened levels of anxiety and depression experienced during lockdowns won't just disappear when restrictions ease. The unprecedented stress and isolation of the pandemic could spark a ""social recession"" with profound and lasting impacts on our health, happiness and productivity, newly-reappointed US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has warned. A commuter waits for a train at London Bridge Station. Laws on social distancing and mask wearing look set to be lifted later this month.Though the long-term effects are not yet known, researchers have expressed concerns that behaviors developed during lockdowns -- compulsive hygiene habits, fear of public spaces or constant checking for Covid symptoms -- will make it difficult for some people to reenter society. A recent study carried out by leading helpline charity Anxiety UK revealed the proportion of people looking forward to resuming normal life and those who would rather stay home was virtually the same: 36%. The Mental Health Foundation, which has been conducting a nationwide study of the pandemic's impact on mental health in Britain, found that during the country's third lockdown that started in January fewer people felt anxious, but more reported feeling lonely and ground down by the stress of the past year. Catherine Seymour, the foundation's head of research, said certain groups were of particular concern, including young people, individuals who are unemployed, single parents and people with pre-existing mental health problems and disabilities, who reported feeling significantly more distressed, compared with British adults generally.""The longer you feel lonely the more chronic it becomes and actually the harder it is to then re-engage in activities,"" Seymour said. ""For people who have been shielding, or have had a lot of their socialization opportunities shut down -- which includes many teenagers who haven't been able to go to school and haven't had activities available to them -- it can be much harder to then reintegrate. We lose a certain amount of confidence in our ability to go out into the world.""Pedestrians, some in masks, cross London's Millennium footbridge. The British government didn't make face coverings compulsory indoors or on public transport until last summer, and masks have never been mandated outdoors.Faced with school closures, curtailed social lives and being at the end of the line for vaccines, young people have borne the brunt of sacrifices primarily meant to protect older people who are at greater risk from Covid-19. But a belief that they would come out the other side of the pandemic more resilient may have been overblown, some psychologists and behavioral scientists say. ""I'm struggling to imagine things going back to how they were,"" said Amy Clement, a 26-year-old stage manager living in London. ""The first half of the pandemic I felt like I could hold on to what I had before, but now it's been so long I feel like I'm having to start fresh."" Last year, life seemed full of possibility to Clement, who had landed her dream job working backstage on The Lion King, touring the United Kingdom and Ireland. But when the pandemic hit, the show was canceled and she found herself living back home with her family. As the British government lifted, reimposed and then extended its series of lockdowns over the past year, Clement said she had been left feeling increasingly anxious about the future, unsure she would ever feel ready to return to work or to go out with friends. ""It was a constant sort of bubbling fear of when we can reopen,"" she said, likening it to a ticking time bomb.Now, with the help of counseling, as well as support from her family and boyfriend, Clement said she has started to move past that sense of panic, giving herself small, achievable goals, making plans and easing back into socializing. People enjoying the sunshine on the south bank of the River Thames in London last month. A cap on outdoor gatherings is due to lift later this month.But not everyone has been able to receive the help they need during lockdowns. Emma Turner, the deputy CEO of mental health charity Mind in Croydon, based in south London, said she was expecting to see a surge in demand for services as people start to re-enter the world. Though many of Mind's counseling services have remained open over the past year, most were delivered remotely and so were not accessible to everyone. ""Lots of people waited to come in person. Now they have resurfaced and they need support immediately,"" Turner said, adding that some put off seeking treatment, thinking the pandemic would soon be over.When Johnson announced the last extension of the lockdown, he told the British public: ""We must, as far as possible, learn to live with this disease as we live with other diseases.""That is an alarming prospect for many. ""It's my biggest fear,"" said Penny, a 52-year-old accountant, who asked to be identified only by her first name. ""I have no idea how I can go out and live with Covid, and live with that constant fear of getting ill.""Penny, who is immunocompromised and lives alone, has barely left her south London home or had any in-person contact over the last year. She says the lockdown has triggered severe anxiety and panic attacks. Despite receiving both Covid-19 shots, she is continuing to shield from the virus. ""Some friends will call and ask if I'm still isolating. They say, 'You can't sit at home forever,'"" she said. ""I want to go out, but I can't. I feel trapped.""""The life I had is gone,"" she added.The crippling social isolation of living alone during the pandemic has been particularly acute in Britain, where the government effectively made sex between single people who were not living together illegal during the first lockdown; even after it lifted, later restrictions were similarly stringent, only allowing single people to form ""support bubbles"" with one other household. Dr. Elise Paul, who leads the UK COVID-19 Social Study, says she often gets asked: ""Will people bounce back?"" ""And the answer is, we just don't know. It's gone on so long,"" she said. ""In terms of single people, or people living alone, they have been reporting more depression symptoms, and more loneliness.""Grew had a busy social life prior to the pandemic. ""I'm very sociable ... it would be quite rare there'd be a weekend where I wouldn't see anyone,"" she said.Families are also struggling with the effects of the pandemic. A recent study published by Britain's Office of National Statistics found that 39% of those who are married or in a civil partnership reported high levels of anxiety, compared with 19% pre-pandemic. The rise was fueled, in part, by the burden of caring for others while juggling other responsibilities.Jessica Pan, a London-based author and self-described introvert, said the first lockdown had rekindled her social anxiety, leaving her feeling scared and isolated just as she found out she was pregnant with her first child. For her book Sorry I'm Late, I Didn't Want to Come, Pan spent a year prior to the pandemic living life as an out-and-out extrovert. Now, as a new mother, fearful for her baby's health, she finds herself turning down almost all social engagements.During a heatwave in June, Pan was tempted by an invitation to a friend's garden -- the holy grail in a city with little air conditioning. Her son played with other babies in a paddling pool, something he had never done before, while she chatted with other parents from her antenatal class who she'd only ever met on Zoom. The next day her son came down with a fever, sending her into a tailspin of regret. ""Thankfully, he tested negative. But it's not worth the risk. I don't want to lie awake at night with my heart racing wondering if I have Covid, or if I've given my child Covid,"" she said. ""The ability to be carefree is just gone and it's so sad.""Weighing the risks of rejoining society has supercharged anxious tendencies for many, and given rise to new fears for others. While researchers wait to see whether one of the world's strictest lockdowns sparks a mental health crisis, one thing is clear from conversations with dozens of Brits: Many are feeling some sort of reopening anxiety.People walk into Oxford Circus Underground Station. Using public transportation again is cited as one of the activities Brits are most anxious about, according to multiple pandemic surveys.""We did this survey on well-being at my work and they did one of those word clouds where they asked everyone to type in what they were feeling. I said I was feeling tired and anxious, and those were the two biggest words by far,"" Grew said, stroking her cat Nelson.""The problem with being isolated like this is you're often thinking, 'I'm a freak. Everybody else is fine and doing great while I seem to be really struggling.' So even just knowing that other people are feeling like this, it's comforting.""If you or someone you know are having thoughts of suicide, call the US National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK).

While Luis Enrique's side certainly dominated those matches, its profligacy in front of goal meant their incessant possession-based football lacked a cutting edge.That all changed in the third group stage game against Slovakia, where an incredible own goal from goalkeeper Martin Dubravka opened the floodgates and Spain went on to score 10 goals across just two matches.Tuesday's semifinal between the two sides was the first time Wembley had been able to host as many as 60,000 fans -- up from 45,000 in previous knockout rounds -- as the UK government had allowed an increased capacity ahead of restrictions being lifted.It had been well over a year since a stadium in the UK had held a crowd of this size and the two sets of supporters were audibly relishing the opportunity to support their teams in their droves.Had you closed your eyes for 90 seconds during the Italian national anthem, you would have been forgiven for thinking you were back in Rome's Stadio Olimpico, where Italy had played its three group stage matches.And while Spain's wordless national anthem didn't quite bring the same level of noise from the sea of red shirts at the opposite end of the stadium, their supporters were unquestionably the louder of the two once the match had kicked off.When some England fans -- sat in Wembley's upper bowl -- started singing ""It's Coming Home,"" the Spanish and Italian supporters united in boos to very promptly drown them out.Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon makes a save whilst under pressure from Ciro Immobile.Once Italy had begun to get a foothold in the contest, the Spanish fans responded with cries of 'Olé' each time the team made a pass during its next spell of possession, cheering wildly after Ferran Torres produced an especially tidy piece of skill.That move eventually ended with Pedri finding Dani Olmo, who picked up his own blocked shot and brought a smart save out of Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, though the Spanish forward perhaps should a done better -- something that has become a common phrase at Euro 2020.Spain was certainly the team that noticeably improved as the half wore on, but Mikel Oyarzabal wasted probably his side's best chance, blazing high over the bar and deep into Wembley's lower bowl after being picked out by Jordi Alba.The first half had an intriguing ebb and flow, with neither side able to exert any meaningful period of dominance. On the odd occasion an Italian player did manage to get in behind the Spanish defense or find a small pocket of space, he was quickly smothered by a number of white shirts.When Mancini's side did finally fashion an opportunity, Emerson could only find the outside of the woodwork from a tight angle, though Unai Simon's outstretched hand was perhaps more casual than the shot merited.Dramatic finishAfter a quiet opening to second half, the game sprung to life as the two teams exchanged quickfire chances.First, a completely unmarked Sergio Busquets should have done better after being found by Oyarzabal on the edge of the area, but he could only send his shot whistling inches over the crossbar, before Chiesa brought a fine save down low out of Simon at the other end.Federico Chiesa curled home a brilliant goal to open the scoring.However, just moments later it would be Chiesa who finally found the breakthrough.Italy's rapid counterattack, started by the quick thinking of Donnarumma, looked to have been cleared by Aymeric Laporte, but Chiesa responded considerably faster than Spain's sluggish defense to pick up the ball and curl a wonderful effort into the far corner.Wembley Stadium erupted and for the first time all evening it was clear just how many Italian supporters had descended on this part of London.Spain responded well, urged on by shouts of 'si se puede'  -- 'yes you can' -- from its supporters, except Oyarzabal and Olmo couldn't as they put their efforts wide of the post when well positioned.Spain then had Simon to thank for keeping them in the game, with the goalkeeper coming out quickly to smother substitute Domenico Berardi's effort.However, Spain soon had the equalizer its improved play deserved. Another lovely passing move was this time capitalized upon, as Morata -- much maligned at times during this competition -- and Olmo played a wonderful one-two and the former collected the return pass in his stride wonderfully, before calmly slotting into the bottom corner.Alvaro Morata after bagging a late equalizer for Spain.With neither side able to find a winning goal, the tie would go to extra time, meaning that every knockout match that Spain had played would last 120 minutes.At this late stage, there were certainly no signs of nerves holding these teams back. Spain fans in particular sensed this tie might be there for the taking and they almost had another goal to cheer just minutes into the first period of extra time.Gerard Moreno's wicked free-kick was parried away from goal by Donnarumma and Marcos Llorente could only help a difficult just wide of the post after some pinball in the penalty area.Italy's supporters had quietened into a nervous hush with their side now on the back foot, while a small section of Spain fans at the other end of the stadium had started performing an impromptu 'Macarena.'The Italians did momentarily have cause for celebration, believing that Berardi had found a late winner, only for the goal to be ruled out forr offside.During the coin toss to decide which end the shootout would be held, Chiellini was laughing as he jokingly tried to convince his counterpart Jordi Alba to allow the penalties to be taken in front of the Italian fans.Alba remained stony-faced, even as a beaming Chiellini picked him up in a bear hug. Donnarumma and Simon also embraced before the shootout got underway.Players of Italy celebrate with their fans following the team's victory against Spain.After Manuel Locatelli and Olmo had exchanged misses with their teams' first spot=kicks, the next five penalties were all scored before Morata saw his weak effort saved down low by Donnarumma.Spain head coach Enrique suggested that Morata was struggling with an injury.""Morata had an adductor problem, but still wanted to take the penalty and that says so much for his personality,"" he told reporters after the game. ""He's been gigantic for us in this tournament ... in professional sport we all have to learn how to win and how to take defeat. That's why I want to congratulate Italy. ""We're going back home to Spain safe in the knowledge that we were clearly amongst the best teams at this tournament.""Jorginho stepped up next, coolly taking his trademark little stutter to send Simon the wrong way and casually roll the ball into the corner.The mass of blue shirts behind the goal heaved as thousands of fans reached forward to celebrate with their hero.Reaching the final was perhaps something even the most ardent Italian supporters could not have confidently predicted before the tournament, but winning the whole thing now seems like a very realistic possibility."

The killing of Luiz -- who was beaten to death outside a nightclub in the northwest city of A Coruna -- prompted protests in Madrid, Barcelona, A Coruna and numerous other Spanish cities this week, drawing thousands who denounced attacks on the LBGTQ community. The two men and one woman who are under arrest, ages 20 to 25, were suspected of direct participation in the attack, according to Minones.

Luiz, who worked at a senior citizens home, was beaten to death by people who punched and kicked him, a spokeswoman in Minones' office told CNN.

","europe, An American lawyer went on a lunch date in Moscow. Now he's languishing in a jail cell in Belarus   - CNN",An American lawyer went on a lunch date in Moscow. Now he's languishing in a jail cell in Belarus ,"(CNN)When Youras Ziankovich, a lawyer with American citizenship, returned to his Moscow hotel after a lunch date with a friend in April, he found four men waiting for him in the street.  Ziankovich's wife, Alena Dzenisavets, says that according to the manager of the Nordic Rooms hotel, the men -- all in plain clothes -- put a hood over his head and bundled him into a car outside the hotel in the Moscow suburb of Ostankino.She told CNN that Youras was then spirited across the Russian border in a three-vehicle convoy and driven more than 700 kilometers (435 miles) to the Belarusian capital, Minsk.       Dzenisavets says she pieced together what happened to her husband through his court-appointed lawyer in Belarus. She has not had any direct contact with Youras for nearly three months. Ziankovich's lunch companion, Alexander Feduta, was detained at the same time. He, too, was driven to Minsk. Feduta served as spokesman for Alexander Lukashenko, in 1994, before falling out with the Belarusian leader. He went on to join the country's opposition.Read MoreA well-known writer in Belarus, he spent time in jail after taking part in a protest in 2010. US, EU, UK and Canada impose fresh sanctions on BelarusOn arrival in Minsk, Ziankovich was taken to the Belarus KGB's pre-trial detention center. He has had occasional visits from the lawyer, but US consular officials have been unable to visit him in the weeks since he was hustled off a Moscow street.    For the Belarusian authorities, detaining Ziankovich was part of a bigger play -- and they were about to make some dramatic claims.      Six days after the abduction, President Alexander Lukashenko told journalists in Belarus of a plot to assassinate him and abduct his children, as part of a coup attempt. ""We discovered the involvement of the apparently foreign intelligence services, most likely, the Central Intelligence Agency, the FBI,"" Lukashenko said. ""Agents flew from the United States, [someone called] Ziankovich. We were trailing and watching them."" The US State Department quickly responded that ""any suggestion that the US Government was behind or involved in an assassination attempt on Lukashenka is absolutely untrue.""       Youras Ziankovich, in an undated photo provided by his wife, Alena Dzenisavets.Two others were arrested in connection with the alleged plot, including Olga Golubovich, a former employee in Ziankovich's law firm. They have all been charged with ""conspiracy or other actions committed for the purpose of seizing state power;"" none has entered a plea. Belarus is also seeking the extradition of five others alleged to have been part of the conspiracy from the US and Lithuania. Konstantin Bychek, head of investigations for the Belarus State Security Committee, later announced that Ziankovich had confessed and was cooperating with the investigation. Bychek told Belarus state television that Ziankovich was involved in attempts to bribe members of Belarus's security forces to join the plot to overthrow Lukashenko. Alena Dzenivasets insists the charges against her husband are ludicrous and that if he confessed it was to save his life. When the Belarusian KGB found out Ziankovich was in Moscow, Bychek said, ""we asked the [Russians] about the possibility of sending a group of Belarusian agents to Russia.""     How Belarus 'hijacking' has redrawn Europe's air map Russia's internal security service, the FSB, said later that the arrests had been a joint operation with the Belarus KGB, aimed at preventing ""unlawful activity.""       Russian President Vladimir Putin backed Lukashenko's claim of a coup plot, complaining in his annual state of the union address ""that even such flagrant actions have not been condemned by the so-called collective West. Nobody seemed to notice. Everyone pretends nothing is happening."" Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov doubled down on the claim last month, saying  ""​It's hard to imagine that US intelligence agencies could have been unaware of such a large-scale activity."" And Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin had discussed the alleged assassination plot on a call with President Biden on April 13.    The US embassy in Minsk says it can't discuss the case -- and because Ziankovich is a dual citizen, consular officials don't have an automatic right to see him.Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) shakes hands with his Belarussian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko during their meeting in Sochi, Russia, on February 22. 'To kill the President'Dzenivasets is worried about his health; she says her husband's lawyer has told her Ziankovich's ""blood pressure is jumping every day.""""He had his medicine with him in a travel bag, but was not allowed to take it,"" she told CNN.   For Lukashenko, claims of a coup plot sponsored by the US served several ends: They allowed him to portray the opposition as reliant on a foreign power, and ready to commit acts of violence. Plus, the cooperation between the Russian and Belarus security services has helped build a rapprochement with Moscow. To promote the government's narrative, Belarus state television produced a melodramatic documentary, ""To Kill the President.""  The program included secret footage of Ziankovich, filmed in the Avignon restaurant in Minsk in 2020. It is time-stamped August 21 -- almost two weeks after the disputed election which led to an explosion of popular protest across the country.  Belarus' contested elections in August 2020 led to huge anti-government protests and calls for the resignation of Lukashenko. Ziankovich is alleged to say: ""I spoke to some businessmen, I will see them after this, they will provide me with a restaurant venue for the first event. I also have the backing of the Jewish capital of America.""  But the audio in the film appears to have been doctored. Ziankovich's words don't match the movement of his lips.    The documentary's narrator says: ""He doesn't hide his goal. His task is to reveal a vulnerability, to recruit and to induce an armed mutiny.""      At the time the secret footage was shot, Ziankovich's wife Alena says, the couple were on a visit to Belarus to see family members and finalize the purchase of a property. ""We wanted to have a house where we could come to meet with the family and friends in summer,"" she told CNN.      She said they also wanted to vote in person in Belarus' presidential election, which took place on August 9.Days after that lunch in Minsk, Alena says, Ziankovich was detained. She'd noticed that they had been followed for several days after attending one of the many protests that were held against the election result, which was widely regarded as fraudulent and which gave Lukashenko a fifth term as President.  Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich appears on state TV as critics decry his detention as a 'hostage'-takingYouras served ten days of what was called ""administrative arrest."" Alena says her husband went on hunger strike while detained, and when released headed straight for the Polish border. Soon after, she told CNN, the couple decided to close their Minsk office ""because it became dangerous for Youras to come to Belarus, and because we did not want to support the dictatorship by paying rent, utilities, taxes.""    Ziankovich has a long history of opposing Lukashenko as a member of the Belarusian Popular Front (BPF) party.  He was granted political asylum in the US in 2011 and became a citizen in 2017 but stayed in touch with a number of Belarusian opposition activists. In 2016 he ran for election to the Belarus House of Representatives, and he has previously tried to raise funds in the US for the BPF. His decision to visit Moscow for a number of meetings in April -- using his Belarus passport -- gave the authorities in Minsk the chance they had been waiting for: To cast at least some of their opponents as the tools of hostile governments.  It's still unclear when Ziankovich and his co-defendants will go on trial.   And his wife has no idea when she will be able to talk to him, let alone see him. The last time they spoke was on April 11, when he called her at home in Houston to wish her goodnight, hours before setting out for that fateful lunch date with Alexander Feduta."

The team put 40 brown trout in a tank of water, containing a level of methamphetamine that has been found in freshwater rivers, for a period of eight weeks, before transferring them to a clean tank.Researchers exposed 40 trout to methamphetamine for a period of eight weeks.Then every other day the researchers checked whether the trout were suffering from methamphetamine withdrawal by giving them a choice between water containing the drug or water without. A further 40 trout were used as a control group.Trout that had spent eight weeks in water containing methamphetamine selected water containing the drug in the four days after moving to freshwater.Read MoreThis indicates they were suffering withdrawal because they sought out the drug when it became available, according to the researchers.The team found that addicted fish were less active than those that had never been exposed to methamphetamine, and found traces of the drug in their brains up to 10 days after exposure.The team concluded that even low levels of illicit drugs in bodies of water can affect the animals that live in them.Drugs excreted from users pass through sewage systems and then discharge from wastewater treatment plants, which are not designed to treat this kind of contamination, into waterways, according to the study.Scientists find cocaine in UK shrimp""Fish are sensitive to adverse effects of many neurologically active drugs from alcohol to cocaine and can develop drug addiction related to the dopamine reward pathway in a similar manner as humans,"" Horky told CNN via email.Horky raised concerns that drug addiction could make fish spend more time around water treatment discharges, which are unhealthy for them, in order to get another hit.""Such effects could change the functioning of whole ecosystems as adverse consequences are of relevance at the individual as well as population levels,"" he said. Drug cravings could prove more powerful than natural rewards like foraging or mating, he added.The fish were later euthanized and their brain tissues analyzed.Mussels in Washington's Puget Sound test positive for opioids, other drugsThe study underlines how humans pollute the natural environment beyond the noticeable things like oil slicks and plastic waste.Horky said the findings of this research had implications for the effects of prescription medicines such as fluoxetine, commonly known as Prozac, on aquatic life.""Current research from teams around the world undoubtedly shows their adverse impact on ecosystems, which in turn can influence humans,"" he said.The study was published in the Journal of Experimental Biology.It's not the first time aquatic life has felt the effect of human pharmaceutical use.In May 2019, researchers in the United Kingdom announced they had found traces of illicit drugs, pharmaceuticals and pesticides in samples of freshwater shrimp.And in May 2018, scientists working in Puget Sound, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean along the northwest coast of Washington state in the US, said that mussels in the area had tested positive for the prescription opioid oxycodone."

The Phoenix Suns have never won an NBA title and the Milwaukee Bucks have won just one -- way back in 1971. The team that lifts the Larry O'Brien trophy is set to delight a city that longs for basketball's biggest prize.The best-of-seven playoff series begins with Game 1 on Tuesday, July 6, in Phoenix with Game 2 taking place on Thursday before the teams fly to Milwaukee for Games 3 and 4. If necessary, Game 5 will take place on Saturday, July 17, Game 6 on Tuesday, July 20 and Game 7 on Thursday, July 22.Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo and Suns guard Chris Paul are two key pieces to the series.Whereas in previous years, a cast of established superstar names have appeared in the Finals to do battle, this year has a sense of freshness about it. Read MoreNo player on either roster has won an NBA ring before, and Jae Crowder of the Suns is the only player to have previously participated in the Finals before -- where he lost to the Los Angeles Lakers last year while with the Miami Heat. READ: Charlie Sifford: golf's first Black professional who paved the way for Tiger WoodsAnd while the teams themselves will have a chance to hoist a championship banner for either the first time or the first time in a long while, there are also some more personal storylines to look out for as the culmination of the NBA season gets underway. For the Bucks, they will be sweating on the health of their superstar forward Giannis Antetokounmpo ahead of Game 1. The two-time NBA Most Valuable Player hyperextended his knee in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Atlanta Hawks, missing the final two games of the series. Antetokounmpo sets up a play against Trae Young of the Atlanta Hawks during Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals.Although reports indicated he might have played Game 7 if that had been necessary and head coach Mike Budenholzer said it's a ""day-to-day"" situation, Antetokounmpo's health could swing the outcome of the series depending on if he can take to the floor or not at a level befitting his talent.Fellow Bucks stars Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday showcased their own abilities in his absence to help lead Milwaukee past a tough Hawks team. On the other side, aged 36 and in his 16th season in the league, star Suns guard Chris Paul finally has a chance to win an elusive ring. Paul has been one of the best point guards since he entered the league in 2005, being named an All-Star 11 times, selected to an All-NBA team 10 times and being voted as the Rookie of the Year in 2006. However, through bad luck, injuries and facing better teams, he's never reached the promised land of the Finals. But having been paired with some rising superstars in Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton, Paul has provided poise and experience to a young team, masterminding their way past the defending champion Lakers amongst others on the way to the Finals. Paul drives to the basket against the LA Clippers during the Western Conference Finals.And of course, the best player of the series will be crowned NBA Finals MVP. The award tends to go to a player on the winning team but has previously been handed out to a losing player. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosIt has only happened once in NBA history, as Jerry West claimed the inaugural award in 1969 after his LA Lakers lost to the Boston Celtics in their seven game series.

 - CNN","Spain says non-consensual sex is rape, toughens sexual violence laws","Madrid, SpainThe Spanish government approved a law on Tuesday to define all non-consensual sex as rape, part of a legislative overhaul that toughens penalties for sexual harassment and mandates more support systems for victims.It approved the bill five years after what became known as the 'wolf pack' case, in which five men gang-raped an 18-year old woman at Pamplona's bull-running festival, causing public outrage and prompting calls to reform laws on sexual violence.The draft still requires parliamentary approval, which is expected by the end of the year.Based around a ""yes means yes"" model, which qualifies any non-consenting sex as rape, the law will bring Spain into line with 11 other European countries, including Sweden, Portugal and Britain, that use similar legal definitions.""What the new law does is put the victim at the center of the public response,"" government spokesperson Maria Jesus Montero told a news conference. ""Silence or passivity does not mean consent.""Spanish court hands four 'wolf pack' members further prison terms over separate sexual assaultRead MoreUnder existing legislation, a perpetrator must have used physical violence or intimidation for an assault to be classified as rape.Stalking and street harassment, considered misdemeanors under current legislation, will become crimes, as will female genital mutilation.Gang rape will be considered an aggravating factor entailing prison sentences of up to 15 years to deter gang crimes similar to others that have shocked Spaniards.In parallel, the measures call for the creation of a 24-hour sexual assault helpline and specialized children's homes for underage victims.Spain has long sought to position itself at the forefront of sexual politics and counter prevailing macho attitudes. It legalized gay marriage in 2007 and introduced a pioneering gender violence law in 2004.Last week the cabinet passed a draft law to allow anyone over 14 to legally change their gender without a medical diagnosis or hormone therapy.Protests erupted across Spain on Monday night in response to the killing of a gay man who was beaten to death in what appeared to be a homophobic attack in the northern city of La Coruna at the weekend.Police in Madrid charged protesters with batons, prompting the government to open an investigation into their conduct."

While her time of 10.82 seconds was less than a tenth of a second faster than her four nearest rivals, it wasn't just the nature of the race that made Devers' win so special, but also the journey she had taken to get there.  In the years leading up to the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Devers endured a series of traumatic health complications -- a ""gamut of symptoms"" which brought her close to retirement before her athletics career had even left the starting blocks.  Weight loss, hair loss, headaches, insomnia, bulging eyes and painful skin sores were some of the health issues that afflicted Devers in her early 20s, driving her to desperate measures over a two-and-a-half-year period.""I looked like a monster ... I couldn't stand the way I looked,"" the 54-year-old tells CNN Sport. Read More""I actually covered up my mirrors and stopped looking at myself. I stopped going out because when I went out, people would ask, 'Hey, what's wrong with you?' and I had no answers.""Devers races in the heats of the 60m hurdles at the World Indoor Athletics Championships in Budapest, Hungary.Around the time of the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, Devers says she had been running as slowly as she did in high school and failed to progress past the semifinals of the 100m hurdles, her favored event. Her condition, which some doctors put down to overtraining, worsened when she returned home; at one point, her weight dropped to 79 pounds -- 40 pounds less than her usual running weight. ""I had given a resignation speech to my coach saying that I didn't want to take up his time because I'm out there competing or trying to compete and I'm pulling my hamstrings by jogging,"" Devers remembers. ""There was a problem, (but) he wouldn't let me resign, thank goodness, and said, 'We'll figure this out.'""It was only after years of visiting health experts across the United States that Devers finally learned she had Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder which causes an overactive thyroid gland. ""Then the tears just started flowing,"" she says of the moment she received a diagnosis. ""Finally, somebody had an answer for me."" READ: Depression drove her close to suicide. Now, Olympian Raven Saunders wants to 'destigmatize mental health'Throughout her career, Devers was easily recognized by her long fingernails. Today, 30 years on from her Graves' disease diagnosis, Devers wants to raise awareness for the condition and its accompanying symptoms -- especially as July marks Graves' disease awareness month.She continues to take medication each day, and only recently discovered that issues with her eyes -- pain, bulging and sensitivity to light -- are linked to thyroid eye disease, a condition related to Graves' disease, but one that requires separate treatment.""If there are 10 million people who could have Graves' disease, then my job, our job is to make sure that 10 million people -- they're under a doctor's care,"" says Devers. After her diagnosis in 1990, Devers received radiation treatment that caused painful blisters on her feet as a side effect of the medication. The situation got so bad that doctors came close to amputating her feet.

""I always tell people that if I had my life to live over, I would ask for my Graves' disease again because it's made me who I am,"" she says. ""I believe I'm stronger at having to go through what I went through ... Everybody's faced with challenges. We all feel like sometimes walls are closing in on us and there's no way out. ""What do you do? You remember that strength and resilience that you have when you step on the line.""Following her 100m victory in 1992, Devers went on to win golds in the 100m and 4x100m relay at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, making her one of just three women to successfully defend the 100m title at the Olympics. Despite winning three world championship titles in the 100m hurdles, Devers' quest for an Olympic medal in that event proved to be ill-fated.In 1992, she was on track for a comfortable victory before hitting the final hurdle and staggering across the line in fifth place. Statisticians later calculated that, had she not stumbled on the final hurdle, Devers would have broken the world record.  Devers (right) dives across the finish line of the 100m hurdles final at the 1992 Olympics having hit the last hurdle. Then in Atlanta four years later, she could only finish fourth in the final; in 2000, she pulled up in the semifinal with a torn hamstring, and in 2004, it was a calf injury that thwarted her progress. However, her 100m gold in 1996 -- when Devers edged out Jamaica's Merlene Ottey after they both clocked the same finish time -- still makes her the last American woman to win the Olympic 100m title. READ: Teenage long jump sensation Larissa Iapichino on the Olympics and matching her mother's recordAt the Tokyo Olympics, which get underway later this month, Devers says she hopes an athlete from the United States can end the 25-year wait for a gold in the women's 100m, but also admits she's a fan of British sprinter and 200m world champion Dina Asher-Smith.Off the back of a career that was shaped by the resilience and determination required to overcome her health battles, Devers is well-positioned to give advice to current Olympians who are approaching the Games after a year fraught with the confusion and uncertainty of the pandemic. ""You've got challenges, you've got stresses, you've got self-doubts,"" says Devers. ""Whether it's swimming, diving, whatever your event is, when you step up to the plate, be ready to put your all on the line so that you don't leave with question marks.""Having competed up to the age 40, Devers still stays active and recently finished her first half marathon. Away from sport, she remains dedicated to raising public awareness of Graves' disease.  ""I've been dealing with things for 30 years,"" she says. ""I need to help people get to the finish line quicker than I got there."""

Johnson said Monday that the ""continuing effectiveness"" of the vaccine rollout allows England to consider loosening restrictions, rather than tightening them, as cases rise.""I want to stress from the outset that this pandemic is far from over,"" Johnson told a news conference. ""It certainly won't be over by [July] the 19th,"" he said. ""We're seeing cases rise fairly rapidly,"" Johnson added. ""There could be 50,000 cases detected per day by the 19th, and again as we predicted we're seeing rising hospital admissions, and we must reconcile ourselves sadly to more deaths from Covid.""Johnson's announcement comes two weeks before the planned date for lifting all restrictions in England. The prime minister added that a final decision on unlocking would be made on July 12, after considering data.Read MoreAs part of the lifting of restrictions -- dubbed ""Freedom Day"" -- there would be a move away from legal restrictions to personal responsibility, said Johnson. Duchess of Cambridge forced to self-isolate after Covid-19 contactThis meant lifting of laws on face coverings, social distancing, and instructions to work from home. ""I don't want people to get de-mob happy,"" said Johnson. ""This is still far from over."" But he added that this was on balance the time to reopen, given the summer season and school holidays. ""If we can't open in the next few weeks ... then when can we?"" Johnson said. Meanwhile the number of infections is predicted to rise if measures are rescinded, but the government believes its vaccination campaign has weakened the link between cases and hospitalizations and death. Around 86% of the UK's adult population has received a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and more than 63% have received a second dose, according to government figures. On Sunday, the UK recorded 24,248 new cases and 15 coronavirus-related deaths. Current restrictions include maintaining a distance of ""one-meter plus,"" the use of face coverings on public transport and inside enclosed public spaces, a cap on the number of attendees at weddings and funerals, the continued closure of nightclubs, and scanning in and out of cafes and restaurants. Pedestrians wear face masks while walking along Oxford Street in central London on June 6.'A personal choice'As a fresh wave of infection continues to swell in the UK, concern is growing among health care experts over the impact of a relaxation of pandemic measures.Deepti Gurdasani, an epidemiologist and senior lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, said the government's decision to press forward with England's unlocking was ""unsurprising"" and would put significant pressure on hospitals once more, in addition to exposing many more people to ""long Covid."" ""The government has consistently ignored the advice and prioritized short-term economic gain,"" Gurdasani told CNN. ""Even at the current rates, we're in for trouble, and opening up further of course increases those risks greatly. Not only would I say we need to really pause opening up further until we vaccinate many more people, but also deal with the current wave.""Unvaccinated people are 'variant factories,' infectious diseases expert saysGurdasani described the government's plan as ""hugely unethical"" and alarming, given ""we know that long Covid is common in young and healthy people.""""This is not the flu, like Sajid Javid seems to suggest,"" Gurdasani said. ""Please tell me when flu has led to 400,000 people having chronic disability in a period of 16 months ... why would we want to expose so much of our population to herd immunity through natural infection when we have safe and effective vaccines that could be given to them in the coming weeks.""Gurdasani urged the government to adopt smarter policies like continued mask use and investment in ventilation in schools and workplaces, while allowing more time for greater vaccination coverage before lifting measures. Pivoting to protective measures as the country emerges from restrictive lockdowns is an approach echoed by the British Medical Association (BMA), which is urging the government not to ""throw progress away"" and maintain some targeted methods to limit the spread of Covid-19 after July 19.Dr. Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair, said in a statement it ""makes no sense to remove restrictions in their entirety in just over two weeks' time"" and called on ministers not to rush to meet their self-imposed deadline. ""We have made excellent progress with both the vaccination campaign and individual action from people across the country over the last 18 months, and the government must absolutely not throw this away at this critical juncture,"" he said. Nagpaul said that although hospitalization numbers were not spiking as high with previous peaks, spiraling levels of community transmission ""provides a fertile ground for new, potentially vaccine-resistant variants to develop.""He also added that evidence suggests one in 10 people suffer longer-term impacts of long Covid, even if they only suffered a mild infection, and that an estimated 2 million people in England were living with long-lasting symptoms. ""These factors could have serious consequences for the NHS and public health teams as well as business, education and wider society -- therefore stemming the spread of the virus in the community with a series of manageable, targeted measures must be the priority right now,"" Nagpaul said.'An abdication of responsibility from the government'Stephen Griffin, an associate professor in the School of Medicine at the University of Leeds, said in a statement provided to the UK's Science Media Centre (SMC) that vaccines provide ""a clear route"" out of the pandemic.He added, however, that the ""impatience with which restrictions are due to be relaxed is likely, in my view, to greatly amplify the number of infections we see caused by the Delta variant, and so cause unnecessary harm along this road."" Griffin added that Johnson's plan, which effectively shifts the responsibility for safety measures from the government to individuals, represented ""an abdication of responsibility from the government."" Britain thinks it can out-vaccinate the Delta variant. The world isn't so sureBut not all medical professionals are in agreement, with others saying the argument for removing all restrictions was compelling. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said in the same SMC statement that ""there is a general consensus that Covid will never go away"" and lifting restrictions over the summer -- when schools are out -- was the right move. ""Even though case numbers are rising quite rapidly at present, possibly as a consequence of celebrations around the Euros [soccer tournament], I still think it would be safer to lift restrictions now than in the autumn. The disease burden associated with a larger peak during the summer would likely be less than one during the winter,"" he said.""Of course we have seen new issues appear during the course of this epidemic and so no one can be certain of the challenges over coming months, but we will eventually come into an equilibrium with this virus as we have with all the other endemic respiratory infections.""CNN's Lauren Kent and Sheena McKenzie contributed to this report"

It refreshes the debate over to what extent Neanderthals, the heavily built Stone Age hominins that disappeared about 40,000 years ago, were capable of artistic expression and symbolic thought and whether they developed these skills themselves or through interactions with early modern humans, who first arrived in Europe around this time. ""The phalanx from Einhornhöhle with its stacked offset chevrons represents one of the most complex cultural expressions in Neanderthals known so far,"" according to a study that published Monday in the journal Nature.The team of German researchers said the small bone appears to be of no practical use, and the chevron design, with its three uniform parallel lines appears to be intentionally created -- perhaps as a personal ornament. Read More""The choice of material, its preparation before carving and the skilful technique used for the engraving are all indicative of sophisticated expertise and great ability in bone working,"" said Silvia M. Bello, a researcher at the Centre for Human Evolution Research, Department of Earth Sciences, at the Natural History Museum in London, in a commentary that accompanied the paper. She wasn't involved in the research. ""The presence of incisions artistically arranged in a chevron pattern on the bone of a giant deer, supports the symbolic meaning of this find and raises new questions about how complex Neanderthal behaviour might have been.""The giant deer bone has no practical use and is believed to be purely decorative.Boiled before decoratedThe bone was from a giant deer, an animal that researchers described as ""very impressive,"" but also one that would have been very rare north of the Alps at the time. Choosing the giant deer bone as the raw material emphasizes the special character of the object and supported that it had a symbolic meaning, they said. The decorated bone was found in the former entrance to the cave about 1 meter  behind the person holding the staff in the right of the image. To understand how the object was made, the researchers made their own versions using stone blades from Baltic flint and carved five bones belonging to Limousin cows. The bones were treated in different ways: one was fresh, another was room dried and a third was dried in the open air, while bone four was boiled once and bone five was boiled twice. ""The fresh bone... it didn't really work out. The bone was really hard. We were constantly slipping with the tools,""  said Dirk Leder, a research associate at the State Service for Cultural Heritage Lower Saxony, Hannover, Germany, and an author of the study.How Neanderthal DNA affects human health -- including the risk of getting Covid-19Leder and his colleagues found that the boiled bones offered a softer ""mellow"" surface to make controlled incisions in a way that closely resembled the original item. They said it took around one-and-a-half hours to make the object using a combination of cutting and scraping. The earliest evidence for cultural innovation and artistic expression among early modern humans emerged in Africa and dates back to around 100,000 years ago -- where we see we see tools made from material other than stone, such as bone, ivory and antlers, shell bead ornaments, and advancements including the use of pigments, cave art and deliberate burials.  Although scarcer, archeologists have uncovered similar technological and cultural innovation at Neanderthal sites in Europe. These include ornaments such as talons from birds of prey, tooth pendants and evidence of funerary behavior. At some cave sites in Spain, there's evidence -- albeit contentious -- that Neanderthals created abstract motifs and hand stencils. Complex behaviorHomo sapiens are thought to have first arrived in Europe about 45,000 years ago and overlapped with Neanderthals for thousands of years. During that time, the two groups encountered each other -- sometimes having sex and babies, leaving traces of Neanderthal DNA in our genes.Given its age, the study authors said they believe the engraved deer bone was of ""independent Neanderthal authorship"" and not linked to any interactions with Homo sapiens. Computerized topography scans of the engraved bone showed six lines that show the shape of the chevron symbol.  They noted that the earliest evidence of Homo sapiens in central Europe comes from sites in the Upper Danube area of between 43,500 and 38,000 years ago -- several millennia after the engraved bone. They said the earliest evidence of Homo sapiens in Europe -- pendants made from animal teeth from 45,500 years ago is from 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) away in Bulgaria.Interactions between early modern humans and Neanderthals were a lot more common than we thoughtHowever, the Natural History Museum's Bello said more recent research had found genetic evidence in a Homo sapien's skull from a site in the Czech Republic -- around 400 kilometers (248 miles) from Einhornhöhle -- that suggested the individual had some Neanderthal DNA, This raises the possibility early modern humans and Neanderthals had interbred more than 50,000 years ago.

To her supporters, the 43-year-old's selection is a decades-in-the-making milestone that exemplifies the Olympic spirit of inclusion and could inspire other transgender athletes who are underrepresented in sport at all levels. Hubbard's opponents -- including conservative British shock jock Piers Morgan -- argue that being a transgender woman, or a woman who was assigned male at birth, gives her an unfair physical advantage. One of Hubbard's competitors even called her inclusion ""a bad joke,"" saying it was unfair to cisgender women, whose gender identity matched their sex assigned at birth. Hubbard hasn't engaged with the firestorm, aside from in a brief statement saying she'd been ""humbled by the kindness and support"" from her countrymen. Read MoreAdvocates for greater diversity in sport say Hubbard's selection shows transgender women don't pose a threat to women's sport -- but the level of backlash against her suggests the fight for inclusion isn't over.Weightlifter Laurel Hubbard told Radio NZ in 2017: ""I'm not here to change the world.""How the rules have evolvedKristen Worley became the first athlete to undergo an Olympic gender verification process when she tried to represent Canada in track cycling at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.Since then, she's been fighting to make sure no one has to endure the same ""humiliating"" process. In 2005, Worley -- who is an XY female -- had a physical examination in a room with four men: two sport administrators, one lawyer and one emergency doctor, Worley wrote in her book ""Women Enough."" That followed an earlier physical examination with an endocrinologist, who asked about her sexuality.""They viewed me as a threat to sport,"" she wrote. ""At best, I was trying to cheat; at worse, I was a freak. They felt utterly entitled to ask me embarrassing, intimate questions about the details of my surgeries, and talk openly about my body in front as me, as if I wasn't there.""Kristen Worley hoped to compete at the Olympics in track cycling. The IOC rules -- agreed on in 2003 and known as the Stockholm consensus -- allowed transgender women and men to compete in the Olympics, as long as they had ""surgical anatomical changes"" (including having their testes or ovaries removed), obtained legal recognition of their assigned sex, and underwent hormone therapy for sufficient time to ""minimize gender-related advantages."" But Worley said those rules had no basis in science.As Worley's testes had been removed, her body produced almost no testosterone. She applied for an exemption to allow her to take testosterone so her body could stay healthy. It took three years before she was finally given permission to take testosterone, but it was still below the level she believed she needed for her body to be healthy. Although testosterone is often associated with men, it also occurs naturally in women. It's not entirely clear how important testosterone is for women, although testosterone supplements for women can help with energy levels, said Amy K. Weimer, the medical director of University of California, Los Angeles' Gender Health Program. Although most transgender women do not take testosterone supplements after transitioning, there are some cases where it is recommended, she said. ""This area is very poorly researched and every person's experience is different,"" she said. Scared and traumatized after the years-long process, Worley quit cycling. She says she lost her career, her Olympic opportunities, her health and her wellbeing. It was five years before she could face getting back on a bike. ""When you're violated in that way ... you never forget it. You just learn how to manage it,"" she told CNN in a Zoom interview. The way her gender identity was publicly discussed destroyed her: ""It made me feel like I was less than half a human being.""Transgender runner CeCe Telfer is ruled ineligible to compete in US Olympic trialsWorley took a case against Canadian sporting bodies and the IOC to Ontario's Human Rights Tribunal in 2015, arguing the enforcement of the 2003 Olympic policy constituted a violation of human rights. Ultimately, that case was settled in 2017, with Ontario Cycling Association and Cycling Canada committing to revising their polices. At the same time, the IOC was reviewing its own policies, and in 2015, it agreed on new guidelines removing surgical requirements. Transgender women could compete in the female category, so long as they had declared their gender identity as female for at least four years, and could demonstrate their testosterone level was below 10 nanomoles per liter for at least a year. Athletes who transitioned from female to male could compete in the male category without restriction. What the science saysJoanna Harper helped write the 2015 Olympic rules but knows there is still a lack of data on how transitioning affects athletes' sporting ability.That's something Harper, once one of Canada's top marathon runners who has competed as a transgender woman for the past 17 years, studies at Loughborough University in the United Kingdom.Harper said while trans women maintain some strength advantage over cis women, it's unclear by how much, especially for elite athletes. In a sport like weightlifting, she said, strength is key -- but agility and technique are important, too. ""Hormone therapy doesn't turn trans women into cis women -- it just doesn't,"" she said. ""The important question is, can trans women and cis women compete against one another in meaningful competition? I would think that the answer is probably yes.""Joanna Harper helped write the 2015 Olympic rules on transgender inclusion.In Hubbard's case, she's not seen as a strong medal contender. The New Zealander is ranked 15th in the world in the super heavyweight 87 kilogram-plus category, according to the International Weightlifting Federation. Her best total is 285 kilograms -- significantly lower than top-ranked Li Wenwen's 335 kilograms. Harper published one of the first studies on transgender women in sport in 2015, which found seven of eight transgender female non-professional runners studied had significantly slower races times after transitioning. Ultimately, they performed at approximately the same level against their female peers as they had against their male peers prior to their transition.  





""It's nonsense to think that everybody who trains can become an Olympic champion.""Dick Swaab,Professor of neurobiology, University of Amsterdam


Transgender athletes aren't a homogenous group, cautions Worley -- an athlete who has transitioned by having her gonads removed will have different testosterone levels from an athlete who hasn't, for instance. Similarly, a woman who transitioned before going through puberty would have virtually no advantage, said Harper. And testosterone levels aren't the whole story. Dick Swaab, a professor of neurobiology at the University of Amsterdam who has studied the brain chemistry of gender identity, said sensitivity to testosterone differs, meaning people may have a high level of testosterone but their body is not able to use it.""The level of testosterone is only a little bit of information about the whole picture. I think the Olympic Committee hasn't even thought about sensitivity and measurements of sensitivity,"" he said. But there's a bigger question about what is a fair natural advantage.""At the level of Olympic champions, those are exceptional people,"" Swaab added. ""It's nonsense to think that everybody who trains can become an Olympic champion."" JUST WATCHEDTransgender pro athlete weighs in on sports inclusion controversyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTransgender pro athlete weighs in on sports inclusion controversy 06:56Some people are born with attributes that make them natural athletes, but they are not treated differently, says Jaimie Veale, president of the Professional Association for Transgender Health Aotearoa and a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Waikato. For example, women over six feet (1.82 meters) tall might have an advantage in sport, too, but no one's saying they can't compete. ""The reality is that we don't think that way, because we don't exclude them as a group, because we actually count them as women. But really this issue comes down to who do we count as women or not,"" she said. ""When it comes down to it, it comes down to still this question of transwomen not being seen as equal citizens.""What's at stakeThe question of how transgender women participate is bigger than just the Olympics -- it gets to the heart of what sport is about.To Australian rules football player Emily Fox, 39, who has received death threats and threatening messages about her children, the presence of transgender women in elite sport is important for visibility -- but ultimately, she sees Hubbard as an athlete who has worked hard and who deserves her place.Emily Fox (upper left) plays Australian rules football for the Williamstown Football Club in Melbourne.""Women's sport has often been a space for women who have tried to exist outside of gender norms anyway, and particularly for same-sex attracted women, sport was often the safe space,"" she said. ""I think that (making sport more exclusive) inherently goes against what women's sport has often stood for.""Ryan Storr, a social scientist and co-founder of Australian charity Proud2Play that encourages LGBTQ participation in sport, said the Olympics were supposed to inspire young people to participate in sport. Instead, transgender youth, who report higher rates of suicidal ideation than cisgender youth, were being discouraged from being part of it.A 2018 survey in New Zealand found trans and non-binary teenagers and adults were almost half as likely as the general population to have participated in any sports in the last month. More than half of those surveyed said they were worried about how they would be treated as a trans or non-binary athlete in competitive sport, and 58% had avoided the gym because they thought they would be mistreated. Anne Lieberman, director of policy and programs from US non-profit Athlete Ally, which aims to promote equality for LGBTQ people in sport, said that for transgender youth, having transgender athletes at the Olympics is ""nothing short of life-saving."" 





""It feels like this is a dream of these young people that we can either nurture or we can shatter.""Jaimie Veale,President, Professional Association for Transgender Health Aotearoa


""It shows them that they can absolutely be fully who they are and play the sport they love,"" Lieberman said. ""It shows them that their identities are real, and that they belong everywhere -- including in sports.""Veale, from the Professional Association for Transgender Health Aotearoa, agreed: ""It feels like this is a dream of these young people that we can either nurture or we can shatter.""What needs to changeMore than a decade after her Olympic examination, Worley says she has chosen to put the past behind her and is working with the IOC to improve the situation for other athletes.""I've gotten to a place where I have to forgive,"" she said. ""Because by forgiving ... it takes my power back.""In a statement to CNN, the IOC said it was developing new guidance to ensure athletes can engage in safe and fair competition, regardless of their gender identity.  





""There's considerable tension between the notions of fairness and inclusion, and the desire and need to protect the women's category.""IOC statement


""Overall, the discussions, so far, have confirmed the considerable tension between the notions of fairness and inclusion, and the desire and need to protect the women's category,"" the IOC said. Worley thinks there are still issues with the rules around transgender women participating in the Olympics -- and she doesn't think there is enough support in place, both from the organization and the public.""I'm more concerned about (Hubbard's) health and wellbeing and to ensure her success and so on because I know the infrastructure isn't there to support her,"" she said.Hubbard declined CNN's request for an interview.  Activists argue there's also change needed at a non-elite level. Eight US states this year banned transgender girls and women in public secondary schools and colleges from participating in girls' and women's sports teams. JUST WATCHEDThe teens at the center of the fight over transgender athletes' rightsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe teens at the center of the fight over transgender athletes' rights 04:45Harper says she has been told by women that it's unfair for her to compete. ""It's hard to face that sort of animosity,"" she said. ""It hasn't really changed that much ... I would love to think that things are getting better. But I'm not sure I see a lot of evidence of that.""Harper believes there should be a two-level approach. For athletes playing at a non-elite level, she thinks they should be allowed to compete where they feel most comfortable -- if they're at a level when blood testing doesn't regularly occur anyway, they shouldn't be blood tested. At an Olympic level, it is appropriate to have testosterone limits and blood testing for trans athletes to ensure meaningful competition -- just in the same way athletes are tested to make sure they aren't doping, she said. Storr envisions a world where sport could be made more inclusive of all genders, perhaps by organizing categories on weight or ability. After all, transgender women aren't transitioning to get an athletic advantage -- they just want to play sport in the category that fits their gender identity. As Hubbard told Radio New Zealand in 2017: ""I'm not here to change the world. I just want to be me and do what I do."""

And the sprint race as well, there'll be a different dynamic,"" Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner told the F1 website, referring to the new sprint qualifying format.""But if we carry this momentum into Silverstone, there's nothing to fear.""Silverstone will be the first of three races this season to feature the sprint qualifying format.Run over 100 kilometers during grand prix weekends, sprint qualifying will give the winner three points down to one point for third.The new format will be also be used at the Italian Grand Prix and the Brazilian Grand Prix later in 2021."

It was Henderson's first ever goal for England.As the clock ticked down, England fans belted out football is ""coming home,"" the chorus to ""Three Lions,"" the adopted anthem of the team's supporters.Three years ago England got to the World Cup semifinals but were beaten 2-1 by Croatia -- despite taking the lead -- and in 2019 lost 3-1 to the Netherlands in UEFA's Nations League tournament.

But that's where we found ourselves Thursday -- at the unveiling of the statue of Diana, Princess of Wales. The two were intimately involved in the design of the long-awaited artwork and the redesign of the Sunken Garden around it. According to Kensington Palace, this was one of Diana's ""favourite locations"" and it's where the young princes played growing up. The poignancy and nostalgia of the moment weren't lost on anyone.  For the first time since Harry left Kensington Palace to set up his own household with Meghan, the brothers issued a joint statement: ""Today, on what would have been our Mother's 60th birthday, we remember her love, strength and character -- qualities that made her a force for good around the world, changing countless lives for the better.""Every day, we wish she were still with us, and our hope is that this statue will be seen forever as a symbol of her life and her legacy.""Prince William, left, and Prince Harry, right, arrive for the unveiling of a statue of their mother, Princess Diana, in the Sunken Garden in Kensington Palace.Memorializing and commemorating their mother and her impact on society is an incredibly important mission for the brothers. They knew everyone would be watching how they interacted and set the tone of the event by entering in conversation and with broad smiles on their faces. They appeared at ease, warmly greeting their aunts -- Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes -- with kisses before laughing and joking with family and guests at the small ceremony. Read MoreAt times it almost felt like it once was -- brothers standing shoulder to shoulder, firmly focused on a single goal. Harry seemed a little more relaxed than his brother, making a few quips and gestures to invitees and engaging in some light banter. But that was like old times, too ... Harry the joker, against William's more reserved positioning as king-in-waiting.They co-commissioned the artwork in 2017 from the sculptor Ian Rank-Broadley and wanted it to ""reflect the warmth, elegance and energy of the Princess in addition to her work and the impact she had on so many people,"" according to Kensington Palace. She is seen surrounded by three children, who ""represent the universality and generational impact of The Princess' work,"" with the brothers choosing to cast their mother's image ""based on the final period of her life as she gained confidence in her role as an ambassador for humanitarian causes.""The princes warmly greeted their aunts Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes at the family event.In a low-key but tightly choreographed event, the brothers each took a corner of the fabric covering the statue and revealed their mother immortalized in bronze. They looked at each other, clearly pleased with how it had all played out. They had worked together on every aspect of the project, with their teams coordinating the media arrangements at the unveiling, and both appeared to get what they wanted out of it.Make no mistake, the issues that have pulled the brothers apart remain. Thursday's event will not have magically resolved the challenges they share or the fact that they are ""on different paths at the moment."" But it did feel like a coming together for the two brothers. They have grown apart personally but are still able to work together professionally for common causes -- and the one thing that will always unite the estranged siblings is keeping their mother's exceptional legacy alive. ROYAL FANS GATHER OUTSIDEHundreds of royal well-wishers gathered outside Kensington Palace despite the closed family event for the statue unveiling. They left tributes and cards at Diana's former residence to mark what would have been her 60th birthday. A small group even sang ""Happy Birthday"" for the late Princess.   @maxfostercnn #Kensington #Palace on what would have been #PrincessDiana's #birthday ♬ Without me - hålandhd   DIANA AT 60: HOW WOULD THE PRINCESS OF WALES HAVE DRESSED IN 2021?Princess Diana arriving at the Serpentine Gallery in London in a gown by Christina Stambolian in 1994Princess Diana's wardrobe has been immortalized in everything from books and exhibitions to photo shoots and even a musical. From her fairytale wedding gown to the so-called ""revenge dress"" she wore after Prince Charles admitted to infidelity, royal fans adored her style transformation.Today there is still plenty of nostalgia surrounding the Princess of Wales' style, and designers continue to be inspired by her ensembles. Diana was known for using her wardrobe for tactful, defiant and symbolic statements but she was also a trendsetter, making garments go viral in the days before that was even a thing.  ""Her style was so very much her own,"" said Jack Carlson, whose label Rowing Blazers recently launched a Diana-inspired clothing line. ""She was not a follower. To the contrary, she did her own thing, and we all watched in wonder and tried to keep up.""Fashion researcher Eloise Moran, who founded the Instagram account Lady Di Revenge Looks, describes Diana as ""a true chameleon,"" adding that the ""People's Princess"" liked ""to mix things up, from both high and low designers.""

Buckingham Palace has promised one memorable party for the Queen's Platinum Jubilee next year -- and the first details of the event appear to live up to the billing. The one-day pageant will be a ""reopening ceremony for the UK,"" organizers said as they unveiled some of their plans at the Victoria and Albert Museum on Tuesday. A marching band, circus acts and street theater will spill out onto the streets of central London. And no celebration would be complete without a giant dragon puppet, right? The one on show at next June's event will be larger than a double-decker bus, with a wingspan the width of the famous Mall road that leads up to Buckingham Palace. The pageant on June 5 forms part of a four-day weekend of events to mark the Queen's unprecedented 70th year on the throne. No other monarch has reached a Platinum Jubilee; Elizabeth II became the UK's longest-serving head of state in 2015. By pitching the festivities as Britain's grand comeback from the pandemic, officials are clearly hoping that the specter of Covid-19 will be in the rearview mirror. A need for social distancing would damp all of the weekend's events, which also include a concert outside the palace and full-fledged Trooping the Colour.  If all goes well, the weekend could be a royal pick-me-up for Britain. ""The Platinum Jubilee weekend is an opportunity for the country to emerge re-energised and renewed, expressing optimism and confidence,"" Nicholas Coleridge, the pageant co-chairman, said Tuesday. ""It will be something of a reopening ceremony for the United Kingdom, following a period of uncertainty and hardship, a catalysing moment of unity and fun.""WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENINGThe Queen ramps up her diary once more. On Friday, the Queen will meet with visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel at Windsor. It caps off a busy week for the monarch, who only just got back home after her traditional annual trip to Scotland for Royal Week. During the four-day visit, the Queen toured the factory that makes the country's iconic orange Irn-Bru soda -- though she left Prince William to sample a cup on her behalf. Then it was back to work, with the monarch meeting Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon for the first time in several months. ""It's very nice to be back again, a year's gap is incredible,"" the Queen said. Their sit-down came hot on the heels of her first face-to-face audience since the pandemic struck with Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week, and just days after she dropped in on the G7 and welcomed President Joe Biden to Windsor. After a year in isolation, the 95-year-old's schedule is packed once again. The Queen and Princess Anne received a briefing from the UK Space Agency and viewed satellite production, at Skypark in Glasgow, Scotland on Wednesday.Philip was on William's mind during a shipyard visit. The late Duke of Edinburgh would have been fascinated to see a new warship under construction, Prince William said as he toured a shipyard in Scotland this week. William said workers building the new anti-submarine HMS Glasgow vessel were ""rightly proud"" of their ""truly staggering"" project. And the tour brought back memories of his grandfather, who served in the Navy during World War II and died in April aged 99. ""My family's affection for the Royal Navy is well known, and, as I saw the work taking place here today, I was thinking of my grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh,"" William said. ""He would have been fascinated and excited to see such advances in skills and technology being put into practice."" 'The Crown' fills out its new cast. Addicts of Netflix's hit royal drama ""The Crown"" still have some time to wait until its fifth season arrives. But the show's latest cast is taking shape. ""Trainspotting"" star Jonny Lee Miller has signed up to play former UK Prime Minister John Major, Netflix revealed last Friday. It's a left-field choice for the Conservative Prime Minister, who served between 1990 and 1997, but the show is known for its actors' remarkable physical transformations. Imelda Staunton is stepping into Olivia Colman's shoes to play the Queen as the show tackles a turbulent era in royal history.  Elizabeth Debicki, Dominic West and Jonathan Pryce are all on board, too. British actor Jonny Lee Miller at a 2017 press conference in BerlinDiana would have been 'so proud.' Prince Harry this week told recipients of the Diana Award that his mother would have been proud of them, in a surprise congratulatory message to those who have worked on issues related to the pandemic. ""Thank you for inspiring us with your brilliance, your determination and your compassion,"" he said in a video message shared on the Instagram page of the Diana Award -- the only charity set up in memory of the Princess of Wales, who died in 1997. ""Our mum believed that young people have the power to change the world. She believed in your strength because she saw it day in, and day out,"" he added.PHOTO OF THE WEEKIt was a big night for English football Tuesday, with the country's team finally emerging victorious against historic rivals Germany. England hadn't won a knockout match against Germany in a major international competition since 1966. An ecstatic William, Kate and George joined delighted soccer fans in celebration at Wembley to watch the Euro 2020 last-16 match. The family were joined in the royal box by other British celebrities, including David Beckham and Ed Sheeran. FROM THE ROYAL VAULTThe 1981 Ford Escort Ghia was an engagement present given to Diana by Prince Charles in May 1981.A car given to Princess Diana by Prince Charles as an engagement present has sold for more than £52,000 ($72,000) at auction. Diana drove the 1981 Ford Escort Ghia ""in the early and happiest part of her relationship with the Prince of Wales,"" auctioneer Reeman Dansie said. And the vehicle fetched more than the auction house had estimated -- despite its famous previous owner helping to rack up more than 83,000 miles on the clock.  Read more on this story here.

Mikel Oyarzabal scored the decisive penalty after a shootout of low quality -- Switzerland missed four of its five attempts. For much of the match, Spain looked to be breezing into the last four of the competition without any trouble. It took an early lead after Denis Zakaria's unfortunate own goal, but struggled to cope with a late Switzerland flurry. Just as the game began petering out in the second half, Swiss talisman Xherdan Shaqiri fired back with an equalizer in the 68th minute after an error in the Spain defense.Momentum then swung in Switzerland's favor, but the joy was short lived. Remo Freuler was shown a questionable red card in the 77th minute, leaving 10-man Switzerland to hold out for penalties through extra-time -- with the match finishing 1-1.Read MoreREAD: UK residents' tickets canceled for Ukraine v England match at Italy's requestMikel Oyarzabal celebrates his side's victory in the penalty shootout. Another own goal Both sides came into the tie off the back of dramatic, and exhausting, round of 16 matches.Spain edged past Croatia in extra-time on Monday, winning 5-3 in an epic tie, whilst Switzerland stunned reigning world champion France with victory on penalties. Switzerland's heroics looked to have taken too much out of the team as it struggled to impose itself in a relatively subdued first half in Saint Petersburg, Russia.Without usual captain Granit Xhaka, who was banned after picking up a yellow card against France, the team looked content on sitting back and soaking up waves of Spanish attack. Unsurprisingly, it was Spain which made the breakthrough after 8 minutes, albeit through fortunate circumstances. Jordi Alba's strike from outside the box took a wicked deflection off Zakaria and the ball flew past goalkeeper Yann Sommer, who was stranded diving the wrong way. Incredibly, it was the 10th own goal scored at the tournament, one more than at each of the previous 15 European Championships combined. Things got worse for Switzerland as its main attacking threat Breel Embolo was forced off the pitch with a hamstring injury with a little over 20 minutes played. Chances were few and far between in the match with Spain totally dominating proceedings after halftime.But, just when a Spain win seemed inevitable, Switzerland's Shaqiri capitalized on a defensive mix-up to sweep home an equalizer in the 68th minute. Despite little danger, Aymeric Laporte accidentally hit the ball against teammate Pau Torres, leaving Remo Freuler to tee up Shaqiri for the goal. Denis Zakaria watches as his deflection puts Spain ahead in the match. Red card But the joy was short lived with Freuler sent off for what referee Michael Oliver deemed a reckless tackle in the 77th minute. On second viewing, and despite VAR agreeing with Oliver, the decision seemed harsh with Freuler seemingly making contact with the ball in a sliding tackle on Gerard Moreno. With the scores level, the tie went into extra-time with 10-man Switzerland holding out for penalties. Despite being so impressive with its spot kicks against France, Switzerland only managed to score one of its penalties against Spain, which itself missed two attempts. Despite the win, questions still remain over Spain's shaky defense and lack of cutting edge. It will certainly face a tougher test in the next round as it takes on either Italy or Belgium on Tuesday."

The boundless energy of the likes of Leonardo Spinazzola and Manuel Locatelli have given this team an exciting attacking edge, while the return of Marco Verratti from injury has given the midfield increased control.Belgium started this match -- perhaps as expected -- on the front foot, with Lukaku finding space in behind the Italian defense on two occasions early on. The chances came to nothing, but it was a sign of things to come as Belgium dominated the opening half hour.Italy thought it had taken the lead against the run of play after Leonardo Bonucci turned home Insigne's free-kick, but VAR ruled the defender had strayed narrowly offside.Along with Eden Hazard, Kevin De Bruyne was also expected to miss this tie through injury -- or at least only be fit enough for the bench -- but head coach Roberto Martinez surprised everyone by including the Manchester City star in his starting lineup.There were certainly no early signs of that leg injury hampering De Bruyne, who was dictating play from midfield and looking explosive on the counterattack. Lorenzo Insigne celebrates after scoring Italy's second.After one of several marauding runs forward, a sweet, left-footed strike brought a brilliant save out of Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. The young keeper was called into action again soon after, turning Lukaku's low shot around the post.But Belgium would be left to regret its failure to capitalize on that early dominance as Italy took the lead on the half hour mark.Barella picked up a loose ball inside the penalty area and somehow jinked his way through three red shirts, before firing a vicious strike in off the far post that gave Thibaut Courtois no chance.Belgium picked up where it left off before the goal, huffing and puffing but not really troubling Italy's back line. Mancini's side may have strayed somewhat from the classic Italian textbook on defending, but many of the hallmarks that have made Italy teams of the past successful still remain, notably in veteran Chiellini's marshaling of the defense.However, it would be Italy that scored again and it was Insigne with one of the goals of the tournament. The diminutive Napoli forward cut inside onto his right foot and curled a wonderful effort past Courtois' outstretched arm and into the far corner.Belgium was shell-shocked, its players stood around with hands on hips as Martinez looked on, arms folded, already with a hint of resignation on his face.But his side was afforded a lifeline just seconds later, as referee Slavko Vincic pointed to the penalty spot following Di Lorenzo's clumsy push -- if a bit soft -- on Doku.Lukaku made no mistake from the spot, hammering his penalty down the middle of the goal.Romelu Lukaku halved the deficit for Belgium, but it wasn't enough.If the opening 45 minutes was up there with the best half of football at Euro 2020 so far, the second period didn't begin in the same manner. Both teams seemed content with catching their breath, but Belgium soon began to press forward in search of an equalizer.The first opportunity came on the hour mark after Doku's incisive run and pass found De Bruyne, who squared the ball across the face of goal. It looked for all the world as though Lukaku would have a simple tap in at the far post, but a deft deflection from Spinazzola just took it out of the forward's reach.Italy's defenders, in particular Chiellini, celebrated with Spinazzola as if he'd scored a goal.Belgium continued to throw everything at Italy, including goalkeeper Courtois for the final corner of the match, but in truth the Italian back line never looked like being breached.For Belgium's 'golden generation' this could well be the end of the road, but Italy -- which failed to even qualify for the World Cup in 2018 -- now has a realistic chance of winning a first major trophy since the 2006 World Cup."

Euro 2020: Belgium vs. Italy headlines enthralling quarterfinalsItalian authorities had already put in place significant controls on UK-based fans attempting to enter the country for the game, imposing from June 18 a five-day quarantine period on anyone entering Italy who had stayed or traveled through the UK in the past 14 days.The decision to cancel the fans' tickets was taken in order to ""ensure that UK residents do not circumvent the quarantine requirements applicable when entering Italy"" UEFA said. The Italian embassy in London was careful to remind fans in a statement Thursday that ""anybody who has been in the UK in the previous 14 days, irrespective of their nationality or residency will not be admitted to the stadium, even if they have a ticket.""""Only those who can prove that they have arrived in Italy at least six days previously, have observed five days of quarantine, and have taken a post-quarantine Covid-19 test with a negative result will be allowed into the Stadio Olimpico.""Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi had previously warned about the impact of England's involvement in the championship. Speaking during a joint appearance with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on June 21, Draghi voiced his opposition to the Euro 2020 final taking place in London ""where contagions are growing rapidly.""A separate statement from UEFA Friday said that ""all the remaining matches of UEFA EURO 2020 will go ahead according to the match schedule as planned,"" adding that final decisions regarding the ""entry requirements to any of the host countries and host stadiums fall to the responsibility of the competent local authorities."""

Asked if she would observe the Rule 50 ban, Berry told CNN's Don Lemon: ""It depends on how I'm feeling. It depends on what I want to do in that moment, and what I want to do for my people in that moment.""Read More""And I will do whatever comes upon me and whatever is in my heart,"" she added.The US Olympic and Paralympic Committee permitted athletes to take part in ""respectful demonstrations on the topic of racial and social justice"" at the trials.In 2019, Berry lost some of her sponsorships after raising her fist in protest on the podium at the Pan American Games in Peru.She received a 12-month probation from the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee for the act, which she says was meant to highlight social injustice in America.Berry (L) drew criticism for her actions from Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Dan Crenshaw, with the latter calling for the 32-year-old to be removed from the Olympic team.READ: Sha'Carri Richardson suspended from US Olympic team after testing positive for marijuanaA complicated historyBerry said she made the decision to protest during last month's trials because she ""will not stand for any type of symbol or song that does not stand for all people in America."" ""It's the first verse, it's the third verse, it's all of these words,"" she specified. ""Freedom, justice. It mentions slaves. These are things that do not hold true for all Americans.""  Penned by Francis Scott Key in 1814, the ""Star Spangled Banner"" was inspired by the American victory at the Battle of Fort McHenry. Some interpret the lyrics in the third verse, where Key mentions the word ""slave,"" as him taking pleasure in the deaths of freed enslaved people, who fought with the British against the United States. The tradition of playing the anthem at US sporting events dates back to 1918, but other Black athletes have suffered from their decision to use that moment to protest about social justice -- notably NFL star Colin Kaepernick.Berry said her desire to take a stand against social inequality is more important than the impact it might have on her career.""I've already been through all of that [...] and yet I am still here, still saying that my Black communities need help.""Long before Colin Kaepernick knelt, a Black female athlete defied the US National Anthem, but she's been largely forgotten'I'm extremely American' The 32-year-old Berry has drawn criticism for her actions, but she has also received support.Whilst White House press secretary Jen Psaki said she hadn't spoken to US President Joe Biden about the incident, she did say he would admit that ""part of that pride in our country means recognizing there are moments where we, as a country, haven't lived up to our highest ideals,"" and therefore defend Berry's right to ""peacefully protest.""""I think that was spot on. They said it, I respect it,"" Berry said in response. ""Let's be clear. I do respect the constitution, because obviously I was exercising my constitutional right.""Berry holds her ""Activist Athlete"" T-Shirt over her head.She acknowledged the condemnation she had received, saying that while she understood why people took offence, she would continue to stand up for what she believes in. ""They can feel how they feel, but I'm extremely American because I'll fight for people here, because we've endured it here,"" she added. ""People are still capitalizing off of our unpaid labor force, more than 400 years [...] so how can they be mad at me for standing up for my people?""When asked if she would one day stand up for the flag or the national anthem, she said, ""Of course [...] until these issues are fixed, until these communities are supported, and until America takes full accountability for the things that Blacks have to face here.""America is the greatest country in the world. We are capable of fixing these issues. I am tired of talking about them. I won't do it anymore."""

The 5-foot-1 ""Pocket Rocket"" finished third in 2016 after winning gold in 2008 and 2012, but she rebounded to win the event at the 2019 World Championships. And in June, she clocked a time of 10.63 seconds, which is the second-fastest 100 time ever for a woman.

The Americans have won the last three gold medals and six of the last seven — only coming up short in 2004. Durant, 32, is one of two returning players from the team that won in 2016, and he'll be looked to for leadership and scoring.

It's a subject that has been at the forefront of these Games following Simone Biles' withdrawal from gymnastics events to protect her mental health. Ledecky, who won her first gold medal as a 15-year-old in 2012, is no stranger to the weight of public expectation; over time, she says she's found ways to manage it.

""They mean a lot.""Sotherton said she keeps her medals accessible rather than putting them up in a frame.Read More""I think it's nice to sometimes put them on,"" she added.The design of the medals changes for each games, and this time around they are the work of Junichi Kawanishi.Each of the gold, silver and bronze medals are 85 millimeters in diameter and range in thickness from 7.7 mm to 12.1 mm.The gold medal is in fact made from gold-plated pure silver, with around 6 grams of gold out of a total weight of 556 grams.A silver medal is worth around $450 if you melt it down.The silver medal is made from pure silver and weighs around 550 grams, while the bronze medal weighs approximately 450 grams and is in fact made from 95% copper and 5% zinc.At today's prices that means the gold medal would be worth around $800 if you melted it down, while the silver would be worth about $450 and the bronze around $5.Earlier this month a winner's medal from the 1896 Athens Olympics sold for $180,000 at auction, Cuban shooter Leuris Pupo's gold medal from the London 2012 Olympics fetched $73,200, and  his compatriot Iván Pedroso's long jump gold medal from Sydney 2000 went for $71,335.

Hubbard's three failed attempts in the snatch -- one at 120kg and two at 125kg -- saw her exit the competition at Tokyo's International Forum. After her final attempt, she waved to crowd and bowed before making her way off the stage. China's world record holder Li Wenwen set three Olympic records as she won the gold medal, first lifting 140kg in the snatch, then 180kg in the clean and jerk to finish on a total of 320kg. Li Wenwen celebrates during the women's +87kg weightlifting competition at the Tokyo Olympics.A close battle for silver went the way of Great Britain's Emily Campbell with a score of 283kg. USA's Sarah Robles won bronze with 282kg. Hubbard has been eligible to compete in the Olympics since 2015, when the International Olympic Committee (IOC) issued new guidelines allowing qualifying women to compete ​in women's events provided their testosterone levels are below 10 nanomoles per liter for at least 12 months before their first competition.Read MoreThere is debate in the scientific community as to whether androgenic hormones like testosterone are useful markers of athletic advantage.

In order to ​qualify for the Tokyo Olympics, 43-year-old Hubbard had to overcome a serious elbow injury sustained at the Commonwealth Games. At the time, she was advised that her sporting career was likely over. However, she recovered and secured her Olympic berth in June. ""I am not entirely unaware of the controversy which surrounds my participation at these Games,"" Hubbard said after competing on Monday.""And as such, I would particularly like to thank the IOC for, I think, really affirming its commitment to the principles of Olympism and establishing that sport is something for all people. It is inclusive, accessible."" The IOC is set to review its guidelines on transgender participation after the Tokyo Olympics, with Richard Budgett, the body's medical and scientific director, saying last week: ""It would have been inappropriate to come out with a new framework or guidelines just before the Olympics. There will be a new framework, with the help of international federations, but it is not published yet."" Hubbard is the first ​known transgender woman to compete in the Games, but ​there is another transgender athlete ​competing in this year's Olympic Games.Hubbard's entry in the history books comes alongside Canadian footballer Quinn, who is the first trans and non-binary athlete to compete at the Olympics. Quinn is also the first trans athlete who is guaranteed a medal at Tokyo 2020 after Canada's semifinal win over the US on Monday. Canadian midfielder Quinn (in red) is the first trans and non-binary athlete to compete at the Olympics.Although fans have been barred from ​attending Olympic events in Tokyo amid the pandemic, officials and team members shouted encouragement from the audience for the women's +87kg competition. Music pumping from speakers between competitors' lifts also contributed to the event's atmosphere. The 21-year-old Li set the bar high with her three lifts in the snatch -- the first of which was two kilograms heavier than any other athlete had managed. She had the gold medal wrapped up with her first successful lift of 162kg in the clean and jerk and went on to also clear her next two attempts at 173kg and 180kg.  Campbell had to clean and jerk 161kg in order to finish ahead of Robles and win silver, and she let out a scream of delight when the lift was confirmed."

With her victory, she became the first Japanese woman ever to clinch two gold medals in a single Games, after she also claimed the 400m individual medley the week before. It made Tokyo 2020 the seventh straight Olympics where the winner of the women's 200m and 400m individual medley has been the same person. Completing the race with a time of 2:08.52, Ohashi finished in front of Team USA's Alex Walsh and Kate Douglass, who took silver and bronze respectively. ""It's surreal,"" Ohashi told CNN's Selina Wang. ""And even now that the race is over, I don't even feel like I swam in the Olympics, but here I am today.""Read More""I was thinking I might lose, I might not be able to catch up, even up to 15 meters left, but I had won the gold medal in the first race, so I was able to relax a lot, and I told myself to try and do my best so that I could finish without any regret,"" she adds. Feeling the pressureIn the lead up to her double-gold triumph, Ohashi, like many athletes, had to deal with the voices of opposition to the Olympics, and the question of whether or not they should really be held -- while also juggling the pressure of competing on a global stage.By the time the Games started in July, there had been a series of public campaigns calling for the Tokyo Olympics to be canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic, including an online petition and protests in Japan's capital, even as the Opening Ceremony got underway.  ""We, the athletes, went into the Olympics with a great deal of confusion,"" Ohashi says. For athletes, the financial and emotional challenges of keeping their Tokyo 2020 dreams alive became exacerbated during the pandemic. While some turned to delivering food for Uber Eats to earn extra cash, others were balancing motherhood or trying to find sustainable ways of keeping in shape, all with reduced access to training facilities. With her victory in both the women's 200m and 400m individual medley, Yui Ohashi became the first Japanese woman to ever to claim two golds in a single Olympics. Hitting rock bottomThe pandemic wasn't the only challenge that Ohashi faced during her journey to becoming a double-Olympic champion. In 2015, she was frequently experiencing fatigue, and despite training, her times were getting worse. That year, she competed in the national championships, where she found herself with the worst time of all 40 competitors who entered the 200m individual medley.After a series of hospital tests, she was diagnosed with anemia, and according to the Olympics website, that's when she ""hit rock bottom.""Once she switched up her medication and diet, her condition began to improve. Two years later, her hard work came into fruition when she won a silver medal in the 200m individual medley at the 2017 FINA World Championships. ""I won a medal at the World Championships in 2017, but then I started feel pressure, and there were times when I couldn't control it, but that experience helped me to control my feelings,"" she tells CNN Sport. But Ohashi faced yet another obstacle in 2019, when the pressure of competing began to take a toll on her mental health, in the form of anxiety. At the 2019 FINA World Championships, she was disqualified because of a stroke rule violation -- in the same event where she had won silver two years prior.Double Olympic champion Ohashi has faced numerous setbacks in her career, including being diagnosed with anemia in 2015 and experiencing bouts of anxiety in 2019. Finding strength in solidarityThat's why the 25-year-old Ohashi empathizes with other young athletes who have spoken out about how the burden of expectation can weigh heavily, especially on young shoulders. From US gymnastics superstar Simone Biles withdrawing from Tokyo 2020 Olympics events to protect ""her body and mind,"" to Japanese tennis star Naomi Osaka writing in a TIME magazine op-ed that she hopes ""people can relate and understand it's OK to not be OK, and it's OK to talk about it,"" more athletes are disclosing the mental challenges that come from competing in the spotlight. Even though both athletes were each met with support from peers including Aly Raisman, Usain Bolt and Serena Williams, they also received judgment, ridicule and criticism from others. Either way, Ohashi hopes that Biles' and Osaka's ability to talk openly about their mental health will encourage people to show more care and compassion to those who experience similar struggles. ""There are probably a lot of athletes who have mental health problems, but I hope that the world will become more supportive,"" she says. ""I'm sure there are athletes who will be saved by them coming out, and I respect their courageous action.""The 25-year-old swimmer says she empathizes with Simone Biles and Naomi Osaka, who have both spoken publicly about how the pressures facing young athletes can provoke mental health struggles. 'It was a miracle'Having come back from rock bottom in 2019 to win bronze in the 400m individual medley at that year's FINA World Championships, Ohashi says that going through physical and mental hardships has only helped her grow as an athlete.""There were times when it felt so hard and I almost gave up swimming, but now I feel that everything paid off,"" she says.Reflecting on her stellar run at Tokyo 2020, she says, ""Of course, I came this far dreaming of winning a gold medal, but I never thought for a moment that I could win a gold medal, even though I had imagined it.""""I am proud of myself for winning two gold medals at the Tokyo Olympics, and I believe that my victory could encourage the Japanese swimming and sports worlds in the future,"" she adds.For Ohashi, her two gold medals stand for something bigger than a double-Olympic victory. She hopes her ability to overcome adversity and make Olympic history can inspire hope -- and help to heal a divided nation. ""I've received a lot of comments from people who said they were moved by athletes winning gold medals and other medals, seeing athletes trying so hard, so I'm very happy about that,"" she says. ""It was a miracle for me to participate in the Olympic Games in my own country, so it was a big event for me, and I hope that I was able to inspire people -- it might be strange to say this but -- inspire those who were against the Games, or people who were not so interested in sports, and I hope I've encouraged them even a bit."""

And then there's dangling a pizza. The United Kingdom is using take-out food discounts and free taxi rides as incentives for young people to get their Covid-19 vaccines, the country's Department of Health said in a statement Sunday.So far, companies teaming up with the UK government include Uber, Bolt, Deliveroo and Pizza Pilgrims. Other incentives could include ""vouchers or discount codes for people attending pop-up vaccine sites and booking through the NHS (National Health Service), social media competitions and promotional offers for restaurants,"" the department added.Europe tried to boost Covid-19 vaccine takeup with carrots. Now some leaders are breaking out the sticksSome of the incentives from companies such as Uber and Bolt have been used in the past. But the measures are resurfacing due to signs of youth vaccination uptake still catching up to older generations.People over the age of 80 were among the first in the country to receive their first shot, in December 2020. Since then, vaccination centers have gradually been working their way down to younger demographics.Read MorePeople under 30 were granted access to their first vaccine dose in June 2021. Around 67% of 18 to 29-year-olds in England have since had a first vaccination, according to the government statement. A total of 84.7 million vaccine doses have been administered in the UK, with 46.7 million people (88.4%) receiving a first dose and 37.9 million (71.8%) receiving both doses.People on the dance floor shortly after the reopening of The Piano Works venue in Farringdon, central London, on July 19.In England, home of one of the world's highest vaccination rates, Prime Minister Boris Johnson loosened nearly all Covid-19 restrictions on July 19, while at the same time announcing that full vaccination would be a condition of entry to nightclubs by the end of September, ""when all over 18s will have had the chance to be double jabbed.""""Though we can see the enthusiasm of millions of young people to get their jabs, we need even more young adults to receive a protection that is of immense benefit to your family and friends -- and to yourselves. And so I would remind everybody that some of life's most important pleasures and opportunities are likely to be increasingly dependent on vaccination,"" Johnson warned at the time.The government has also launched several pop-up vaccination centers across the country, to encourage walk-ins. It said over 600,000 people were vaccinated last weekend at such clinics, including London's Tate Modern Gallery and the Primark clothing store in Bristol."

It appeared online after Timanovskaya was told she will no longer be able to compete for Belarus and that she must return to the capital, Minsk, immediately, said Anatol Kotau, of the Belarus Sports Solidarity Foundation. The group represents Belarusian athletes repressed by Belarusian authorities.Kotau, who is in direct contact with Timanovskaya, said that at around 3 p.m. (2 a.m. ET) on Sunday, representatives of the Belarus national team came to the Olympic village and asked her to ""pack her belongings as a decision had been made for her to return to Minsk.""""I am afraid that I might be jailed in Belarus,"" Timanovskaya said in an interview with the Belarusian sports news site Tribuna on Sunday. ""I am not afraid of being fired or kicked out of the national team. I'm concerned about my safety. And I think that at the moment it is not safe for me in Belarus.

Kotau added that the athlete was scheduled to be on flight TK0199 to Istanbul, departing at 10:50 p.m. Tokyo time.Kotau said that as soon as Timanovskaya arrived at the airport, she approached a Japanese police officer and said she would like to apply for political asylum.'All Belarusians are hostages to Lukashenko's regime,' say citizens now cut off from EuropeThe Belarusian National Olympic Committee said Sunday that Timanovskaya was withdrawn from the Games due to her ""emotional and psychological state.""""According to the doctors' conclusion, due to the emotional and psychological state of the Belarusian track and field athlete Kristina Timanovskaya, the coaching staff of the national track and field team decided to stop the athlete's performance at the Games of the XXXII Olympics,"" the committee said in a statement on their Facebook page.

Her mind had searched for positive thoughts in between the two races, first turning to her grandparents, then to the bigger pictures of what winning a sixth Olympic gold of her career would mean. ""I've gone to children's hospitals and met wounded warriors, and their faces light up when they see the gold medal,"" Ledecky told reporters after her 1500m victory while struggling to hold back tears. ""That means more to me than anything, the ability to put a smile on someone's face ... So many people around the world are going through a lot of hard things; I'm just lucky to be here.""Ledecky reacts to her 1500m freestyle victory in Tokyo -- the first time the distance has been held as a women's event at the Olympics.While many expected Ledecky to face fierce competition from Australian Ariarne Titmus in the 200m freestyle on Wednesday -- one of her four gold-medal events in Rio five years ago -- few would have predicted her to finish so far down the field. Read MoreBut the 1500m provided a more familiar sight, the 24-year-old racing into an early lead that she maintained over the course of the 30 laps. American teammate Erica Sullivan won silver, just over four seconds behind Ledecky's winning time of 15:37.34, while Germany's Sarah Kohler took bronze. READ: Simone Biles withdraws from all-around final at Tokyo 2020 to focus on mental healthA 'pretty darn tough' mindsetGiven her blistering form this year, coupled with her gold medal haul in Rio, the American came into these Games with weighty expectations -- mostly, she admits, from herself. ""I am always striving to be my best and to be better than I've ever been,"" said Ledecky, who holds world records in the 400m, 800m and 1500m freestyle events.  ""It's not easy when your times are the world record in some events. You can't just keep dropping time every single swim, (but) that's kind of the attitude I have when I approach each race ... And that's pretty darn tough.""Victory in the 1500m was Ledecky's sixth Olympic gold medal. That attitude, she added, can be both a blessing and a curse -- motivating her to keep chasing her own standards, while also forcing her to constantly train and compete against her own high expectations. ""I've gained perspective over the years,"" she said. ""I've really learned a lot over the years. The times (in Tokyo) might not be my best times, but I'm still really, really happy that I have a gold medal around my neck right now.""While fans have been kept away from venues in Tokyo amid the pandemic -- often creating an atmosphere of eerie quiet -- athletes filled the stands on one edge of the pool for Wednesday's races, cheering teammates and waving banners.Chants of ""USA"" rang out around the venue as Ledecky streaked down the pool on her final length of the 1500m -- the first time the distance had been held as a women's Olympic event -- to finish 17 seconds outside her world record time from 2018.Titmus rules the poolAn hour before Ledecky toasted her first gold of the Games, her rival Titmus was celebrating a second. The Australian, who beat Ledecky to 400m freestyle gold on Monday, also took victory in Wednesday's 200m freestyle final, with Hong Kong's Siobhan Haughey in second and Canada's Penny Olesiak third. Stepping off the podium having collected her gold medal, Titmus broke down in tears as she embraced coach Dean Boxall by the side of the pool. ""I'm pretty good at containing my emotions ... (but) now that I haven't got to swim tonight, I think I kind of let it out a little bit,"" she told reporters. ""Seeing him (Boxall) emotional makes me emotional.""Titmus and Boxall embrace after the 200m freestyle. As for the race itself, Titmus admitted that she was ""a little bit surprised"" that Ledecky wasn't with her at the front come the final length. The pair are expected to go head-to-head once again in the 800m freestyle final on Wednesday. ""I feel good,"" said Titmus. ""I've been utilizing the rest that I have as much as I can, so this afternoon I'll just try and relax.""Tom Dean's Covid battleIn Wednesday's other swimming results, Yui Osashi extended Japan's stunning gold medal haul in these Games with victory in the women's 200m individual medley, while Hungary's Kristof Milak took gold in the men's 200m butterfly. The session closed with a victory for Great Britain in the men's 4x200m freestyle relay final ahead of the Russian Olympic Committee and Australia.

Britain's winning 4x200m relay team from left to right: Duncan Scott, Tom Dean, James Guy and Matthew Richards.The victory was particular poignant for Dean, who has twice contracted Covid-19 during the course of the pandemic.""The second time much worse than the first, I was quite ill for about 10 days and by myself the whole isolation period,"" he told reporters. ""It's a slow build back up because of the nature of the sport we do and the nature of the disease ... I was stuck inside, unable to even exercise inside my own flat. ""It was tough to kind of wrap my head around that during an Olympic year.

It was an eventful start to the race on Sunday, where five cars were knocked out during the first lap.Competing in wet and slippery conditions, Mercedes driver Valtteri Bottas failed to brake correctly while attempting to overtake McLaren's Lando Norris, running into the back of his car and causing him to slide across the track and collide with Verstappen -- while Bottas himself crashed into Verstappen's Red Bull teammate Sergio Pérez.Despite sustaining a severely damaged car, Verstappen pressed on, falling away from third to finish the race in 10th position.Read MoreBut that wasn't the only calamity on the track. Further back, Aston Martin driver Lance Stroll clashed with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, who then collided with McLaren's Daniel Ricciardo.After mistakes from both Valtteri Bottas and Lance Stroll, five drivers were knocked out in the first lap at the Hungarian GP on Sunday.Eventually, the race was red flagged due to a buildup of debris, and Bottas, Pérez, Stroll and Leclerc were all eliminated on the first lap. McLaren retired Norris during the race suspension, attributing their decision to the damage incurred to his car. Once the race restarted, all of the remaining drivers pitted apart from Hamilton, whose car was the only one on the starting grid. With 15 cars remaining, the fight for the checkered flag continued. Hamilton -- who went into the race with a pole position and has won the Hungarian GP eight times -- battled from the back of the grid to the podium. The extra effort demonstrated by the British driver perhaps taking more out of him than usual as he had to see a team doctor after the race for ""fatigue and mild dizziness.""""@LewisHamilton is currently seeing the team doctor, suffering from fatigue and mild dizziness,"" the Mercedes Team tweeted after the race. At the front of the pack, Ocon defended his lead against four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel to win one of the most thrilling Hungarian Grands Prix of all time.""What a moment. It feels so good. It's the first victory since the Renault group came back into Formula 1,"" Ocon said. Ocon also paid tribute to teammate Fernando Alonso, who managed to keep Hamilton behind him for much of the race and give Ocon a chance to fight for first place. ""What can I say? It's fantastic, so congrats to Fernando as well because I think the win is also thanks to him with the fight that he did, his teamwork, all that. I think it's been a fantastic day,"" Ocon added. After the race restarted, Alpine's Ocon defended his lead from Aston Martin's Sebastian Vettel to claim the first F1 victory of his career.Bottas, who was given a five-place grid drop for the upcoming Belgian Grand Prix and two penalty points on his license for the crash, acknowledged his error had caused ""a mess.""""I had a poor start,"" said Bottas. ""Wheelspin off the line, and lost places, and then braking into [the] first corner, I was right in the gearbox of Lando and I just locked the wheels."" ""So probably being that close didn't calculate quite right the braking point, locked two wheels, hit him and then it was a mess,"" he added.""There's not much to say is there?""

It capped a glorious few minutes for Italy at the Olympic Stadium with Jacobs' victory coming shortly after Gianmarco Tamberi's gold medal in the high jump. The two men embraced as Jacobs -- the first Italian man to win 100m gold at the Olympics and the first European man to do so since Great Britain's Linford Christie in 1992 -- surged across the finish line.""It was my childhood dream to win an Olympic Games, and obviously, a dream can turn into something different, but to run this final and win it is a dream come true,"" said 26-year-old Jacobs.Read More""I want to thank my family that has always supported me, my children, and my mom, who has been my number one fan since I was a child, and my team who have followed me and those who support me.""Jacobs takes victory in the men's Olympic 100m final. On a hot, humid evening in Tokyo where the temperature hovered around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), the race got underway in nervy circumstances when GB's Zharnel Hughes was disqualified for a false start.It proved to be a stroke of luck for Jacobs, who had the slowest reaction time out of the blocks -- more than half a second -- during the first start. Jacobs, Kerley, and De Grasse all ran personal bests in the final, with De Grasse adding another bronze medal to the one he won at the Rio Olympics five years ago. In the first men's 100m final since three-time champion Usain Bolt retired from athletics, Jacobs -- whose winning time was 0.01 seconds faster than Bolt's in Rio -- was an unlikely successor to the Jamaican. He had been competing in the long jump until as recently as 2017 before switching his focus solely to sprinting. ""I really didn't know anything about him. It was my first time racing him at the Monaco Diamond League (in July),"" Kerley later said of Jacobs. ""He did a fantastic job (here).""Jacobs (left) and Tamberi embrace  after the men's 100m final.Kerley had finished third at the US Olympic trials in June behind Trayvon Bromell -- billed as the favorite to win the 100m title ahead of the Olympics -- and Ronnie Baker. However, Bromell was unable to qualify for the final in Tokyo and Baker finished fifth behind South Africa's Akani Simbine.""I executed the race perfectly and I came up with a silver medal. I can't complain,"" said Kerley.""The race was a beautiful race. I got a PB (personal best) and a silver medal. I am blessed to be at the biggest stage of my career.""On an incident-filled evening in Tokyo, Tamberi shared the men's high jump gold medal with Qatar's Mutaz Essa Barshim. The two men had identical records after clearing 2.37 meters in the final, but neither was able to clear 2.39.Shortly before that, Venezuela's Yulimar Rojas smashed the women's triple jump world record by 17 centimeters, sealing the gold medal with a distance of 15.67 meters."

Defeat only heaps further pressure onto the shoulders of Koeman. The Dutchman scored the winning goal to end Barcelona's long awaited search for the European Cup in 1992, but now presides over a team seemingly miles away from such glory.Read More""I'm not going to argue about the level of my team,"" Koeman told reporters after the game.""There's no point in comparing this with Barcelona teams of years gone by. That's as clear as water.""I can only give you my opinion of my work at the club -- I feel backed by my players and their attitude. The rest, the club, I'm not sure ... I can't say any more because I don't know what the club thinks in that sense. It's not in my hands,"" Koeman added.Koeman watches as players leave the field at half time.Midfielder Frenkie de Jong jumped to his compatriot's aid, but his efforts may well be futile, with Spanish press reports suggesting that Koeman's sacking could be imminent.  ""I don't think changing the coach is the solution,"" De Jong said.""I can't talk about Koeman, it's not my place. We have to keep fighting, stay together and overcome this situation. We can only escape this with hard work and being united as a team.""The writing was on the wall inside three minutes in Lisbon -- Darwin Núñez scampering behind Barcelona's high-line far too easily before cutting in and sliding a low effort past Marc-Andre ter Stegen.Luuk de Jong was gifted a golden chance to equalize later in the half when his namesake squared the ball for an open goal, but the Dutchman inexplicably fluffed his shot -- the ball heading closer to the corner flag than it did to the net.Rafa Silva added a second before Núñez converted a penalty for his brace, putting the result beyond doubt with just over ten minutes to play.Benfica players celebrate after Núñez scored his side's third goal.Yet Barcelona still found time to inflict further misery on themselves -- summer signing Eric García sent off for a second yellow card in the closing stages.As they had done against Bayern two weeks ago, Barcelona ended the game with a string of youngsters on the pitch. Before García's early departure, the average age clocked in at just over 22-years-old. Many of these young players -- none more so than the highly talented Ansu Fati and Ronald Araújo -- now face the burden of attempting to drag the club out of this current nadir, a challenge made even more difficult by Barcelona's dire financial state.Last month, President Joan Laporta revealed the full extent of the club's ""very worrying"" situation, stating that Barcelona were now over $1.5 billion in debt with a negative net worth of $515 million. Barça host Dynamo Kyiv on October 20 in what has surely already become, on just the third match of the group, a must-win game.Whether Koeman will be on the sideline for Kyiv's visit to the Camp Nou remains to be seen, but Barcelona's mounting woes are all too visible."

Spain striker Paco Alcácer eventually did open the deadlock for the visitors, tapping home from close range just after halftime. A superb volleyed equalizer from Brazilian left-back Alex Telles leveled the scores, before -- as he's done countless times before -- Ronaldo rifled home from inside the box to rescue Manchester United at Old Trafford.

The Portuguese international was playing his 178th Champions League match, becoming the all-time leading appearance maker after surpassing his former Real Madrid teammate Iker Casillas. Ronaldo is already the record scorer in the Champions League, with his goal on Wednesday taking his tally to 136, with Lionel Messi second on 121 goals. However, it didn't start well for the English giants against Villarreal, as Unai Emery's side started well on top. Through the pace and slick passing of Alcácer and Arnaut Danjuma, Villarreal caused United no end of problems and was left scratching its head at how it didn't score in the first half. But the breakthrough came just eight minutes after the halftime break, Alcácer poking home from Danjuma's low cross. The goal seemed to ignite the home side into action, needing a sweetly struck volley from Telles to level the score on the hour mark.

A deft touch from Jesse Lingard laid the ball to Ronaldo and, at an acute angle and with Villarreal goalkeeper Gerónimo Rulli off his line, the veteran forward manager to blast the ball home to salvage three points.

""And they didn't play like they were rookies. They stepped up to the plate and they all wanted it.

","europe, Sarah Everard: Wayne Couzens, ex-UK police officer gets life in prison with no chance of parole - CNN",UK police officer who murdered Sarah Everard gets life in prison with no chance of parole,"London (CNN)A British police officer has been sentenced to life in prison without parole for the abduction, rape and murder of Sarah Everard, a case that sparked outrage and a national debate about violence against women. Prosecutors said Everard was walking to her London home on March 3 when Wayne Couzens used his police identification and handcuffs to deceive her into getting in his car under the pretense that she had violated Covid-19 rules. He raped her and strangled her with his police belt later that evening.Couzens was sentenced Thursday to a whole-life prison term, which is very rare in the United Kingdom and reserved for exceptionally serious crimes. It means the defendant is never considered for parole. Delivering the sentence in front of a packed courtroom, Lord Justice Adrian Fulford described Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive, as a ""blameless victim of a grotesquely executed series of offenses"" and called the case ""devastating, tragic and wholly brutal."" Read in full: Lord Justice Fulford's full remarks on Wayne Couzens sentencing, and family impact statementsThe judge added that Couzens, 48, had spent the entire evening of March 3 ""hunting a lone female to kidnap and rape."" Couzens was fired from London's Metropolitan Police in July, days after he pleaded guilty to Everard's kidnap, rape and murder.Read More""You have irretrievably damaged the lives of Sarah Everard's family and friends ... you have eroded the confidence that the public are entitled to have in the police forces ... you have utterly betrayed your family,"" the judge said in his sentencing remarks. Standing in the dock, Couzens kept his head bowed and his eyes closed, as he had done throughout the whole two-day sentencing hearing. The judge made a point of criticizing Couzens' behavior in court, saying he had seen ""no evidence of genuine contrition on your part as opposed to evident self-pity.""Everard's parents Jeremy and Susan, her sister Kate, and many of her friends were in court at London's Old Bailey -- the central criminal court of England and Wales. A life sentence is mandatory in murder cases in the UK, but it is usually up to the court to decide the minimum length of time to be served before the possibility of early release. Couzens' whole-life term is exceedingly rare. According to data from the UK Ministry of Justice, there were only 60 whole-life prisoners in the UK as of June 2021, out of nearly 7,000 inmates serving life sentences.Couzens' defense lawyer Jim Sturman QC failed to convince the court that the crimes didn't meet the test for the imposition of a whole-life prison term. He argued there were several mitigating factors, including Couzens' early guilty plea and what he said was genuine remorse, his underlying depression and the lack of prior convictions. ""He is filled with self-loathing and abject shame, as he should be,"" Sturman told the court shortly before the sentence was delivered. In this court sketch provided on September 29, Susan Everard, right, the mother of Sarah Everard, reads a victim impact statement as Wayne Couzens, left, sits in the dock.Everard went missing on the evening of March 3 after leaving a friend's house in Clapham, south London. Her remains were found days later in woodland near Ashford, Kent -- more than 50 miles from where she was last seen.Couzens was later arrested at his home in Kent, close to where Everard's body was found. Due to his guilty pleas there was no trial, but the sentencing hearing over the past two days was an opportunity for the prosecution to present the facts of what happened in March and for Everard's family to read impact statements. Prosecutor Little summarized Couzens' actions as ""deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation, fire."" Little also detailed what eyewitnesses to the kidnapping on March 3 saw, saying they observed Couzens handcuff Everard, who appeared compliant and had her head down. They thought he was an undercover police officer arresting a woman.Murder of young teacher makes women in London worry it could have been themEverard was alive for hours after her kidnapping, and was moved to Couzens' own car later that evening, the prosecutor said. ""In order to have done so and without her escaping or trying to escape or make a noise, it can be inferred that he, at least, must have threatened her,"" Little told the court. Prosecutors believe Everard died around 2.30 a.m. on March 4, several hours after she was kidnapped by Couzens. Everard's family was given the opportunity to speak in court on Wednesday, demanding that Couzens, who spent the hearing with his eyes closed and head bowed, look at them while they read their statements.Sarah's mother, Susan, said her daughter ""spent the last hours on this earth with the very worst of humanity. She lost her life because Wayne Couzens wanted to satisfy his perverted desires ... He treated my daughter as if she was nothing and disposed of her as if she was rubbish. I am haunted by the horror of it.""Everard's family said they were ""pleased"" with the sentence handed to Couzens. ""Nothing can make things better, nothing can bring Sarah back, but knowing he will be imprisoned forever brings some relief,"" they said in a statement. A woman holds a placard outside the London's Old Bailey court on Thursday.Epidemic of violenceEverard's disappearance prompted an outpouring of grief and rage across social media from women sharing their own experiences of sexual assault, while also shining a light on the epidemic of violence against women and girls in the UK. ""You have very considerably added to the sense of insecurity that many have living in our cities, perhaps particularly women, when traveling by themselves and especially at night,"" Lord Justice Fulford also told Couzens during the sentencing. The UK is facing a reckoning on gender-based violence. Boris Johnson's government has botched its responseOne woman is killed by a man on average every three days in the UK, according to data from the Femicide Census, an organization that tracks violence against women and girls. The group argues that the government's new strategy to curb such violence ""shamefully ignores"" victims of femicide.The government promised to take action to tackle violence against women and girls, but activists and the opposition say the steps it proposed were not adequate. The murder of elementary school teacher Sabina Nessa earlier this month convinced many that nothing has changed since Everard was murdered six months ago. The man accused of murdering Nessa, Koci Selamaj, also appeared in the same court as Couzens later on Thursday. Prosecutor Alison Morgan said the murder was a ""premeditated and predatory"" stranger attack and that Selamaj inflicted ""extreme violence"" on Nessa, PA Media reported. Selamaj was remanded in custody and a plea hearing has been set for December. His lawyer Aidan Harvey has previously indicated Selamaj would plead not-guilty, PA reported. Police officers stand on duty outside the Old Bailey, England's central criminal court, as they await the sentencing of Wayne Couzens for the murder.London's Metropolitan Police force has also faced a barrage of criticism for their actions in the days after Everard's disappearance. Women were reportedly warned by police officers not to venture out alone as they made door-to-door inquiries on the case, prompting some to comment that this approach only fueled the culture of victim blaming. Meanwhile, the police regulator, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), is investigating whether the Met responded appropriately to a report that Couzens indecently exposed himself at a South London fast food restaurant in February. The IOPC is also investigating alleged failures by Kent Police to investigate another indecent exposure incident linked to Couzens from 2015. Speaking outside the court on Thursday, the Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said Couzens had brought shame on the police. ""There are no words that can fully express the fury... and sadness that we all feel about what happened to Sarah. I am so sorry,"" she said.

For diver Matty Lee, a return to 'gruesome' preseason training","(CNN)Eight weeks since he won Olympic gold with a somersaulting dive in Tokyo, Matty Lee's life is moving at a more sedate pace. Rather than launching himself off a 10-meter platform alongside diving partner Tom Daley, he now finds himself house-sitting for his teammate and fellow gold medalist. ""He's got a hundred plants in this place, and if no one's here, they'll all die,"" the 23-year-old Lee tells CNN Sport. ""He's also got some frogs and fish; I have to feed them every morning.""When the pair took gold in the men's synchronized 10m platform in July, it was the first Olympic medal of Lee's young career and the third for Daley, who also went on to win a bronze in the 10m platform in Tokyo. For Lee, a whirlwind of celebrations and media opportunities -- as well as a holiday -- followed; the thrill of winning Olympic gold hasn't faded just yet, but the return of his unforgiving training routine is bringing him back down to earth with a sizable splash. Read More""I am still finding it very weird to be back at training. I'm like: 'Do I really want to be here? This is really hard,'"" says Lee.""Preseason isn't easy in any sport. It's where you get back into fitness. It's gruesome, but I just know I need to get through this bit, get back in shape, then I'll feel good and then I can set goals. So I'm not rushing to any conclusions.""Lee (left) and Daley compete in the men's synchronized 10m platform diving final.Added to the challenge of preseason is that Lee is doing it all without Daley by his side. The British pair had trained and competed together for three years leading up to the Olympics, forming an unbeaten partnership throughout 2021. But it's unclear whether the duo will continue to compete together, with Lee saying he doesn't want to ""pester"" the 27-year-old Daley to make a decision while he's in North America with his husband, screenwriter Dustin Lance Black.""I loved training alongside Tom for the past three years and it feels really flat without him,"" Lee adds. ""We get along so well, and we have literally trained together for the past three years. Everything we do, we do it together. Because obviously with synchro, we're trying to build that bond where we don't have to think about being in sync, it's all very telepathic.""READ: How male artistic swimmers are striving for acceptanceGuarding the gold medalIn between training, house-sitting duties and finding a new place to rent, Lee adds that he's still on ""cloud nine"" from the Tokyo Olympics -- his debut Games. And while most of his medals are stored in a cabinet at his parents' home, the Olympic gold rarely leaves his side.""I feel like it just needs to be wherever I am,"" says Lee. ""I let people touch it, I let people wear it, I let people hold the weight, but I've always got a good grip on the ribbon itself because if they drop it, then I'll catch it. So it's yet to get a dent on it.  ""I was told by Tom -- because obviously he's got many medals and many medals of his have been dropped -- and he says that every chip tells a story, so not to look at it in a negative way, more a positive, cool way.""JUST WATCHEDOlympic gold medalist breaks internet with cardiganReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHOlympic gold medalist breaks internet with cardigan 01:16'I can't believe I did that'In order to win gold in the men's synchronized 10m platform, Lee had to hold his nerve as the final went down to the wire.Daley and Lee led the Chinese pair of Cao Yuan and Chen Aisen by less than two points ahead of the last round. When crunch time arrived, they claimed the gold with a flawless, four-and-a-half somersault dive. It was Britain's first ever gold medal in the event and ended China's winning run that stretched back to 2000. ""It's interesting to look back on it,"" says Lee. ""Every so often, I come across a video I've been tagged in on Instagram or whatever, and it's my dive or my reaction with Tom. And I can't believe I actually did that.""I've had some crap moments in the sport where I've just bottled it -- last dive, I've just not done what I've had to do and rolled the dive on my back, made a big splash, and then didn't get good points and then not got on the podium. ""But just to know that I actually did it when it actually counted on the biggest stage in the world in sport, me and Tom ... it was obviously the best moment of my life.""Daley and Lee embrace during the synchronized 10m platform final. Which begs the question: how did he manage to produce one of the best dives of his career when it mattered most? ""One thing I've changed -- and I think the pandemic actually helped -- was mentality, my mental strength,"" says Lee. ""My physical strength has always been there; I've been able to do the dives. I know I can do them well because I do them in training. But in the competition, it's all mental. You've got to have no doubt in your mind, you can't think ahead of your dive.""That helped to take care of his own performance, and as for his partner, Lee says he never had any doubts that Daley -- one of the faces of the British Olympic movement for the past 13 years having made his debut aged 14 -- would deliver.""He's the only synchro partner I've ever had where it's just been like: I know he's fine,"" says Lee. ""I know I can count on him because he is that good ... Trying to stay in the moment, think about what I'm doing right now, right then, simplifying everything in my mind -- that's the main thing that actually improved in my diving career. And that helped me reach Tom Daley's level and get the gold medal with him.""While it remains unclear whether Lee and Daley will dive together again, the former's focus remains on his training. Last week, that also involved participating in TRX training as part of the UK's National Fitness Day initiative on top of his diving commitments.

New South Wales, which includes the country's biggest city of Sydney, will now seek to halve emissions by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. Its previous commitment was 35%.The announcement was made by NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, who is from the same Liberal Party as Morrison. The Liberals are the country's center-right conservatives. She said that the plan would not only boost the economy but also create thousands of jobs and slash energy prices in homes across the country. ""Our Net Zero Plan is expected to attract more than $37 billion in private sector investment into NSW, support more than 9,000 jobs, save households about $130 on their electricity bills and help NSW become Australia's first trillion-dollar state by 2030,"" Berejiklian said in a statement.""This is about putting the policies in place to give industry and investors certainty, not only to protect our planet but to future-proof our prosperity and way of life."" Scott Morrison may snub the COP26 climate talks as Australia becomes more isolatedRead MoreThe growing pressure within Morrison's own party comes as his government faces scrutiny by Australia's traditional international allies over what is one of the poorest pledges on emissions in the developed world.  Australia has pledged a cut of 26-28% by 2030 from 2005 levels, around half that of what the US is pledging and well below those of its other close allies, the UK and European Union. Those allies have committed to net zero by 2050 at the latest, while the Australian government has refused to do so.The governments of every state and territory in Australia has also committed to net zero by 2050, essentially putting the country on track to meet the goal. NSW Energy and Environment Minister Matt Kean said the state could turbocharge its economy while halving its emissions by 2030.""We can be a renewable energy super power and as global demand for low carbon products and investments grows, the fortunes of the state are increasingly tied to the fortunes of our planet,"" Kean said.The Morrison government has said it will release a new plan on climate ahead of COP26, but its focus has been on ""tech not taxes"" and it has not signaled any intention to improve on emissions.Independent lawmaker Zali Steggal welcomed the NSW government's announcement in a tweet, saying that the country now needs a federal plan,""After years of denying and delaying, the Morrison Government is scrambling to come up wit a Net Zero plan,"" she said.  Greta Thunberg roasts world leaders for being 'blah, blah, blah' on climate actionCNN has contacted the Prime Minister's Office for comment. It confirmed to CNN on Tuesday that the Prime Minister was considering skipping the COP26 international climate talks in Glasgow, for which more than 100 world leaders have already confirmed in-person attendance. Ministers are this week convening in Milan for a pre-COP26 meeting in which different countries will seek to align their goals on issues like when to phase out coal and how to keep focus on containing global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, which is required to stave off the more catastrophic impacts of the climate crisis.Australia is the world's second-biggest exporter of coal and has said it will continue to mine and sell the fossil fuel abroad well beyond 2030. COP26 President Alok Sharma is looking for an agreement for developed countries to stop using coal by the end of this decade at Glasgow. Climate Action Tracker, a group that monitors climate policies, said that if the whole world followed Australia's policies, temperatures would rise by between 2 and 3 degrees.A recent UN state-of-the science climate report found that Australia is already experiencing more heat extremes and higher sea level rises than the global average because of climate change. Heat, sea level rise and drought are all projected to increase in Australia the more the Earth warms, and annual wildfires are already often devastating to communities, the environment and public health."

However, referees and other staff who work closely with players are required to be fully vaccinated.Earlier this month, the NBA warned that vaccine mandates set by New York City and San Francisco could prohibit players of the Brooklyn Nets, New York Knicks and Golden State Warriors from competing in home games this season if they are not vaccinated or exempted.Players from visiting teams who compete at the city's arenas are not included in the local governments' vaccination mandates.Kyrie Irving: NBA star the latest to withhold vaccination statusCNN learned this week that the Knicks have fully vaccinated all their players, whereas the Nets and Warriors have yet to do so, or gain exemptions.The NBA denied Golden State Warriors star Andrew Wiggins' request to be exempt from the vaccine for religious reasons, making him ineligible to play home games until he reaches San Francisco's vaccination requirement, the league announced on Friday.Brooklyn Nets point guard Kyrie Irving did not disclose his vaccination status Monday during the Nets media day. He also did not say if he expected to be vaccinated or compliant by the time the Nets return home following their preseason game against the Lakers on Sunday. He said he wants ""to keep that stuff private.""""I'm a human being first,"" Irving said. ""Obviously living in this public sphere, it's just a lot of questions about what's going on in the world of Kyrie and I think I just would love to just keep that private and handle it the right way, with my team and go forward together with the plan.""Orlando Magic forward Jonathan Isaac tweeted from his verified account on Sunday that he believes it's a person's ""God given right to decide if taking the vaccine is right for you! Period!"" NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar calls for unvaccinated players to be removed from teams Isaac clarified his comments on Monday during a news conference saying he's not anti-vax, anti-medicine or anti-science.Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal, who could not compete at the Tokyo Olympics after being placed in USA Basketball's health and safety protocols, said he doesn't ""feel pressure"" to get the vaccine, ESPN reported.Basketball Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar told CNN's Don Lemon Monday that unvaccinated players aren't ""behaving like good teammates or good citizens.""""This is a war that we're involved in. And masks and vaccines -- they are the weapons that we use to fight this war,"" Abdul-Jabbar said. Abdul-Jabbar also told Rolling Stone players who are not vaccinated should be removed from the team.

Not Bryson DeChambeau though. Nicknamed 'The Scientist' for his dedication to trialing and utilizing new techniques and technologies, the 28-year-old participated in the Professional Long Drivers Association World Championship on Tuesday, just two days after Team US' historic 19-9 win over Europe at Whistling Straits. In the opening round in Mesquite, Nevada, DeChambeau averaged a massive 406.2 yards on his five longest tee shots, with drives of 412, 408, 407, 403 and 401 yards. DeChambeau reacts to his eagle on the first green during Sunday's Singles matches at the 43rd Ryder Cup.With his score of 800 points over the five sets he competed in, DeChambeau qualified for the next round of the 80-man Open Division. Read MoreThe opening round is broken up into five 16-man groups. Within those groups, there were sets during which players could earn 200 points for winning a set, 100 points for finishing second in the set and 50 points for finishing third. In his group, he finished second with the top 12 in each group advancing to the next stage. Of those 64 players, 32 advance to the third stage on Thursday. The final 16 make it to Friday, when the surviving eight are cut down to the final four and then a head-to-head match for the world title.""I felt like I just won something today, I won a big PGA tournament, even though I just qualified for the next day because it's my first time,"" DeChambeau said afterwards.""It's so exciting, it's a bit of, I guess you could relate it to more of like a shot-putting exhibition or something, I think Olympics, where you're just as hyped up as you possibly can be. So being out there the first set was a little nerve wracking for me, I wasn't comfortable. But going through the second, third, fourth, fifth, I just got more comfortable as time went on.""Despite his huge 412-yard drive, there were 13 drivers longer than DeChambeau, including nine who hit multiple drives further than him. Top-ranked Kyle Berkshire, who hit 11 drives of 413 yards or more, hit the biggest attempt of the day: a 455-yard bomb.Before the start of the Ryder Cup, the 2020 US Open champion said he had ""wrecked"" his hands preparing for the long drive contest.

He wowed crowds consistently over the three days in Wisconsin for the Ryder Cup, even producing an extraordinary 417-yard drive on the par-five fifth hole to leave him just 72 yards to the pin. He eventually finished the hole with an eagle on the way to helping the US to their romp of a Ryder Cup victory, the largest winning margin in the competition's 94-year history."

He later used his police belt to strangle and kill Everard, prosecutor Tom Little told the Old Bailey -- the central criminal court of England and Wales. Little summarized Couzens' actions as ""deception, kidnap, rape, strangulation, fire."" Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive, went missing on the evening of March 3 after leaving a friend's house in Clapham, south London. Her remains were found days later in woodland near Ashford, Kent -- more than 50 miles from where she was last seen.Couzens was later arrested at his home in Kent, close to where Everard's body was found. Prosecutors said in July that Everard and Couzens ""were total strangers to each other"" before he abducted her from the roadside. On Wednesday, prosecutor Little said Couzens lured Everard into a rental car by falsely arresting her for Covid-19 violations, ""handcuffing her as well as showing her his warrant card.""Read MoreLittle also detailed what eyewitnesses to the kidnapping saw, saying they observed Couzens handcuff Everard, who appeared compliant and had her head down. They thought he was an undercover police officer arresting a woman. Murder of young teacher makes women in London worry it could have been themEverard was alive for hours after her kidnapping, and was moved to Couzens' own car later that evening, the prosecutor said. ""In order to have done so and without her escaping or trying to escape or make a noise, it can be inferred that he, at least, must have threatened her,"" Little told the court.Prosecutors believe Everard died around 2.30 a.m. on March 4, several hours after she was kidnapped by Couzens. ""The defendant informed the psychiatrist that he strangled Sarah Everard using his belt. Given all the circumstances this would be consistent with his police belt,"" Little said.They believe this happened prior to 2.34 a.m., which was when Couzens went to a petrol station and ""bought two bottles of water, an apple juice, a Lucozade Orange and a carrier bag,"" Little said. ""There is no CCTV [video] from the petrol station at the relevant time due to a system upgrade having taken place. However the defendant was not to have known that and to have left her alive (even in the boot of the Seat) would have been foolhardy,"" Little said. Wayne Couzens seen in a handout photo issued by the Metropolitan Police.Couzens burned Everard's body in woodland in Kent, the court heard. ""He was to burn Sarah Everard's body after he murdered her. He then moved her body in green bags that he had purchased specifically for that task,"" Little said.A few days later, Couzens took his wife and two children on a trip to the same area. ""It follows that the defendant ... took his family on a family trip to the very woods where days earlier he had left Sarah Everard's body, then returned to burn it and returned again to move it and hide it,"" Little said. The prosecutor also said that Couzens told his family that he was working on the night of March 3, when he kidnapped and subsequently murdered Everard.Wednesday's emotional hearing saw Everard's family speak in court, demanding that Couzens, who spent the hearing with his eyes closed and head bowed, look at them while they read their statements. Sarah's mother, Susan, said her daughter ""spent the last hours on this earth with the very worst of humanity. She lost her life because Wayne Couzens wanted to satisfy his perverted desires ... He treated my daughter as if she was nothing and disposed of her as if she was rubbish. I am haunted by the horror of it.""Kate Everard, Sarah's sister, told the court: ""You used your warrant card to trick my sister into your car. She sat in the car handcuffed for hours. What could she have thought she had done wrong? What lies did you tell her? When did she realize that she wasn't going to survive the night? I'm constantly replaying in my head. ""You get small nuggets of information and the thought process starts again ... My only hope is that she was in a state of shock and that she wasn't aware of the disgusting things being done to her by a monster,"" Kate added. Couzens is due to be sentenced on Thursday. He is expected to receive a mandatory life sentence, but the prosecution is seeking a whole life order, a term only granted in exceptional cases and under which there is no possibility of parole.Speaking to the court on Wednesday, Everard's father, Jeremy, told Couzens that ""no punishment you receive will ever compare to the pain and torture that you have inflicted on us."" An epidemic of violenceEverard's disappearance prompted an outpouring of grief and rage across social media from women sharing their own experiences of sexual assault, while also shining a light on the epidemic of violence against women and girls in the UK.One woman is killed by a man on average every three days in the UK, according to data from the Femicide Census, an organization that tracks violence against women and girls. The group argues that the government's new strategy to curb such violence ""shamefully ignores"" victims of femicide.London's Metropolitan Police force has faced a barrage of criticism for their actions in the days after Everard's disappearance. The Met is also alleged to have failed to investigate multiple indecent exposure incidents linked to Couzens, who was fired from the force in July, days after he pleaded guilty to the kidnap and rape of Everard. Women were reportedly warned by police officers not to venture out alone as they made door-to-door inquiries on the case, prompting some to comment that this approach only fueled the culture of victim blaming.The police's rough handling of protesters at a vigil for Everard was met with anger. A March vigil for Everard dissolved into violence when a predominately-male cluster of officers attempted to disperse the crowd, who police say were in breach of Covid-19 regulations.  Meanwhile, the police regulator, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), is investigating whether the police responded appropriately to a report that Couzens indecently exposed himself at a South London fast food restaurant in February. The IOPC is also investigating alleged failures by Kent Police to investigate another indecent exposure incident linked to Couzens from 2015. Couzens joined the Met in September 2018 and was posted to a response team covering the Bromley area in southeast London. He then moved to the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command in February 2020, where his ""primary role was on uniformed patrol duties of diplomatic premises, mainly a range of Embassies,"" a Met statement said.CNN's Laura Smith-Spark, Kara Fox, Livvy Doherty and Schams Elwazer contributed to this report."

The Argentine star curled home a sublime left-footed effort from the edge of the box in the 74th minute to give the French giants a two-goal advantage. Midfielder Idrissa Gueye had given PSG an early lead, only for Manchester City coming close to equalizing as Raheem Sterling and Bernado Silva both hit the bar in short succession. But Messi's goal -- coming in his fourth appearance since leaving Barcelona -- wrapped up the group stage victory in Paris. After the game, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola -- who coached Messi during their time together at Barcelona where they won two Champions League titles -- praised the PSG star, calling the 34-year-old ""unstoppable.""Read MoreMessi celebrates after scoring his team's second goal against Manchester City.""We dealt with PSG first of all, but we know it's impossible to control Leo for 90 minutes,"" Guardiola said.""He was not much in touch with the ball -- of course, he was coming back from injury, he needed a bit of rhythm -- but we know quite well when he can run and get close to the ball, he is unstoppable.""What we have done is minimize, as much as possible, these kind of options and create the chances that we could create and I'm satisfied with the way we played.""People can't deny that we were there. We arrived here, we did our game, but it's always a risk when you lose the ball and they can make one pass, especially with (Marco) Verratti -- an exceptional, extraordinary player -- and make contact with Neymar and Messi and they can run, it's difficult.""After he scored his goal and as PSG attempted to hold on for the victory, Messi did his part for the team, laying down behind a defensive wall at a freekick to prevent a shot being taken underneath it and surprising goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. However, former Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand believed a player of Messi's caliber shouldn't have been made to perform such a duty. ""The moment Mauricio Pochettino asked him to do that at the training ground, someone should've gone in there and said: 'No, no, no, no, no, no.' This doesn't happen to Leo Messi,"" Ferdinand, a Champions League winner with Manchester United in 2008, said on BT Sport. ""No, no, no, no. You can't. It's disrespectful, I wouldn't have it. If I was in that team, I'd have to say: 'Listen, I'll lay down for you.' Sorry, I couldn't have him laying down like that. I can't see it. He don't get his kit dirty, that's not what Messi does.""Messi lies behind the PSG wall as they defend a free kick against Manchester City. ImprovingMessi signed a two-year deal at PSG in August, ending his two-decade spell at Barça.During his first three games for the club, which were blighted by a lack of preseason training and injury, Messi hardly set the world alight, failing to record a goal or an assist. On his home debut for PSG, seemingly to the six-time Ballon d'Or winner's chagrin, he was substituted by manager Mauricio Pochettino in the second half as his side went in search of a winning goal against Lyon. Pochettino and Messi didn't shake hands and the pair had a brief exchange as Messi made his way to the bench.PSG went on to win the Ligue 1 clash thanks to a Mauro Icardi header in stoppage time and Pochettino defended his decision to replace Messi.However, at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday against Manchester City, the Argentine superstar looked somewhat back to his dominant best, picking up his typical trademark pockets of space and combining well with Kylian Mbappé and Neymar. And just over 15 minutes from the end of the match, with the result still hanging in the balance, the Parisian crowd got what they wanted as Messi used his trademark left foot to score past a rooted-to-the-spot Ederson.

Afterwards, Messi stressed the importance of earning a positive result after PSG's disappointing opening 1-1 draw against Club Brugge.""I hadn't been able to play recently and this was only my second game in this stadium,"" he told Canal+. ""I'm adapting to my new team. The more we forwards play together, the better our relationship will be. We all need to grow together and improve and keep giving our best."""

It's a barely a moment in time, but for a power lifter, 17 seconds is an eternity. At the 2019 World Championships in Helsingborg, Sweden, the 31-year-old Lebanese lifter reached down to the barbell, attempting to deadlift more than three times his own weight: 255 kg.First, his hamstrings and gluteal muscles took the strain, and then his quads. As his lower back engaged to pull the weight farther off the ground, his blood pressure would have been going ""through the roof,"" according to his coach Josh Brame.With his entire body now quivering under the enormous stress, the agony was etched all over his face; his bulging eyes looked up, as if searching for inspiration, before he finally raised the weight to his thighs and locked his knees into place. Read More""I did not let go of those weights,"" he told CNN Sport, ""Because, deep down, I was lifting my country up. This is why I kept going for a whole 17 seconds with 255 kgs in my hands. That's what I was feeling at the moment, and I will do that every single time I lift the bar, I'm just lifting my country up, day by day, year by year. That's it.""Shiva Karout, pictured training here in September 2021, says he is very proud to represent the country he loves.'Cars were flipped over'The country of Lebanon and its nearly seven million citizens are in desperate need of a lift.According to the United Nations, 82% of the population lives in multi-dimensional poverty. The economy has collapsed, prices are skyrocketing and according to Henri Chaoul, a former adviser to Lebanon's finance ministry, chaotic governance has put the country on a ""train to hell."" Earlier this year, Chaoul told CNBC that the metaphorical train was about to reach ""the last station."" Few images could ever illustrate the catastrophic unraveling of a nation quite like the extraordinary explosion that rocked the port city of Beirut on August 4, 2020, when a warehouse full of ammonium nitrate exploded. In an instant, more than 200 people were killed, thousands were injured and 300,000 people were made homeless.   Stored in the port since it was confiscated in 2013, the explosive material left a 400-foot wide crater and a trail of destruction spreading more than 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the epicenter of the blast. Why the volatile material was being stored there remains a mystery to the judge who is overseeing a criminal negligence investigation that has made little progress. Some former officials are being sought for questioning, according to state media. A report published by Human Rights Watch in August, summed up some of the reasons why.""A range of procedural and systemic flaws in the domestic investigation have rendered it incapable of credibly delivering justice. These flaws include a lack of judicial independence, immunity for high-level political officials, lack of respect for fair trial standards, and due process violations,"" the report found.When it happened, Shiva Karout was just 700 meters away (2,297 feet). He was standing with his hands on his head outside his gym, Barbell House, transfixed by the huge clouds of smoke and what sounded like the crackling of fireworks. But then, he says that a normal day turned to the apocalypse; at 6:08 p.m., the sun disappeared.""It was just a huge blast,"" he recalled. ""It was like, it was a mushroom cloud."" Karout compared the feeling to being in a video game when a player's avatar dies and regenerates. He says that when he woke up, his neighborhood resembled a war zone.""Suddenly, it was gloomy, ashes everywhere. Cars were flipped over. Dead people were on the streets, people cut open. The gym looked like rubble.""It's been estimated by a team of experts at the University of Sheffield, that the blast was one of the most powerful artificial non-nuclear explosions in history. The equivalent of more than a kiloton of TNT had been detonated in an instant, creating a shockwave that was felt in four neighboring countries, heard as far away as Cyprus, 150 miles to the northwest, and which the United States Geological Survey says generated a seismic event of a 3.3 magnitude on the Richter Scale.     A cell phone video shot by one of Karout's friends shows him watching the fire, then the immediate destruction and the chaotic aftermath. The powerlifter had borne the full force of the blast with his body, but he says he was lucky to have been on the street, outside.He broke down with emotion as he described the scene of carnage back inside the gym: ""It was upside down; everything was broken into pieces. We had plenty of casualties and a really dear friend of ours, he passed away.""Karout says the lifters who frequent the gym are more of a community than clients, more family than friends. ""Everyone knows everyone in here, I've been training with this guy for four years straight, six days a week. I think of him every single day, honestly. Every single day."" More than a year later, he's still raw with emotion, and even if he wanted to forget, he can't: some of the blood just won't wash off the barbells.A picture shows the scene near the port, where the explosion took place. 'Hell on earth'Shiva Karout followed his father into martial arts, telling CNN, ""He believed that it makes a person humble, and it makes them a bit wiser."" From the age of three, Karout was involved in martial arts himself, also taking yoga classes with his dad, and at five, he ventured into karate and judo, winning ""plenty"" of fights and tournaments. At the age of 21, he began fighting in Mixed Martial Arts and Boxing, winning some and losing some. ""This is life,"" he reasoned. ""We don't always win, [but] we [always] learn.""By 2015, he'd discovered powerlifting, and in 2018, he went professional, quickly finding success in only his second international competition in Dallas, Texas. ""I got awarded best lifter of the event and it was the first time I was sponsored. This is where my journey began and this is where I began hunting to become world champion.""Karout believes that anybody can lift weights, if they train hard enough, but what makes him special is his attitude. ""What I believe I have different than most of the other people is the mental state,"" he said. ""What I've been through as a citizen of Lebanon, we've been through a lot. I believe that my mental game is much, much stronger than any other lifter out there.""Being Lebanese is not just what you hold in your passport, it's something really deep inside, it's blood related."" He goes on to describe the hardships that plague everyday life for so many of his compatriots, ""As a Lebanese, you tend to survive every single day. You tend to survive life itself.""All over the world, gym walls are plastered with motivational slogans and Barbell House is no different. Step through the doorway at 435 Pasteur Street and you'll see the words ""Love Your Pain"" in large white letters on a black background. But Shiva Karout says the reality of training in Beirut these days is more like ""Hell on earth."" ""You don't get the electricity you need; you don't get the water you need. It's not even a third world country."" He explains that the government is only able to provide three hours of electricity per day, after which the residents are on their own. Many try to keep the lights on with generators, but lately, the gas that powers them has also been in short supply.He says that recently he has spent weeks training in the dark, without lights, fans, or air conditioning. ""It's 31 degrees [88 degrees Fahrenheit], it's humid, you're training with a lack of oxygen and high pollution. It was really suffocating for me."" And then there's the economic situation, the crippling inflation which has made purchasing just the gas to keep the generators running impossible for many. The World Bank estimated inflation to be at about 85% in 2020, raising the price of basic food by 400%. Karout explains that $700 in Lebanon is now worth just $60.So, in addition to training for the World Championships in Sweden, Karout says he has two extra jobs: He works at the gym as a personal trainer from 6:30 a.m. until 8:30 p.m., before returning home to work on his food preparation business -- ""Shiva's Cuisine."" Sometimes, he also waits tables in a restaurant, adding, ""This is how I'm able to survive in this country.""Karout has tattoos on his body  which he says tells his story. READ: A city 'ruined in 30 seconds': Lebanese basketball great weeps for Beirut'Excruciating pain'Rarely has any athlete pursued the goal of becoming a world champion in such difficult circumstances, but to make matters worse, Karout also contracted Covid-19, spending one day in hospital, 11 days in bed and three weeks ""in excruciating pain."" He says that at the nadir of his suffering, he couldn't even hold his phone to speak with his friends and family.The economic situation meant that he could no longer afford a trainer, but from 7,000 miles away, help came to him. Perhaps fittingly, that help is called ""Raise the Dead."" That's the name of a powerlifting team in Texas, trained by 32-year-old Brame, who has become one of Shiva's biggest fans.They met a couple of years ago, when Karout was traveling alone in the US, and he asked Brame for some smelling salts -- a powerlifter's trick to help gain focus. Despite his intimidating appearance, Brame says he took to him immediately.""He looks like one of the most intense men I've ever met,"" Brame told CNN Sport, describing his beard and neck tattoos. ""But he's incredibly nice. Rocking personality. Something that is unfaltering about Shiva is that he is all about honor, to a T. When he lifts, he thanks his judges, he puts a smile on, he gets excited, and his energy is contagious.""Karout's sense of honor almost prevented him from working with Brame because the Texas coach was offering to help for free.""He did not want to take my services because he valued me more than that,"" said Brame. ""I had to combat him two or three times, saying 'I believe in you, I want to love on you, and I want to help get you back to worlds.' He thanked me highly and said, 'I think I want to do that.'""Shiva's such a great guy and what he's had to go through is incredible. My heart really went out for him because no world class athlete should have to train uncoached.""Brame now watches videos that are sent from the gym in Beirut, providing feedback and helping with training schedules. He's impressed with how much stronger Shiva has become over the last four months and thinks that a top-10 finish is now well within reach.A tattoo depicts the explosion with tears forming the outline of Lebanon. 'Traumatized'Shiva says he doesn't know how many tattoos are covering his body; they're all connected to each other, pieces of art that represent his story, his life, and the way that he thinks. Anything on the right tends to be positive; the bad things go on the left.His right arm is one of his favorites, bearing an image of his late father along with the Buddha, the Virgin Mary, a Hindu sign, a church and a mosque and a saying from the Quran. He says that he is highly spiritual and will never judge anybody based on their religion. On his left leg, there is an image of his eye, which represents his view of the 2020 blast. Reflected within the eye, a depiction of the explosion and the tears which are running down his leg form the shape of the Lebanese map.It's an event that still haunts him and which always motivates him. He told CNN: ""Every single one of us had someone that either died that day or was wounded, and every single one of us that saw this explosion or lived this explosion is traumatized."" He describes the deaths as ""murder,"" adding that more than a year later, there is still no explanation of how it happened or who was responsible.  Since then, he has trained in clothing bearing the names of all the victims. He says that's now all he thinks about when he trains.""I don't think about anything else because I'm not doing it for self-pleasure or self-satisfaction. I'm doing it to represent my country. I'm doing it to represent my people, to give hope for my people. Regardless of whatever is happening to us, we can still get out there and achieve our dreams; we can still do it.""I will never quit because, if I quit, I'd be quitting on my people and not on myself. There is no way I'll be quitting on them."""

","europe, Public urination at Glastonbury Festival leaves traces of cocaine and MDMA in river - CNN","Public urination at Glastonbury Festival leaves traces of cocaine and MDMA in river, posing threat to rare eels","(CNN)Public urination at Glastonbury Festival led to illegal drugs entering a river running through the famous Somerset site in southwestern England, potentially harming wildlife, according to a new study. Researchers at Bangor University in Wales discovered high levels of cocaine and MDMA in the Whitelake River, which runs through Worthy Farm, where the hugely-popular music festival is usually held with more than 200,000 attendees.The study found MDMA concentrations quadrupled the week after the 2019 festival, while cocaine concentrations reached levels previously shown to affect the life cycle of European eels -- which are present in the river and are critically endangered.Christian Dunn, a professor in wetland science at Bangor University, who led the study, told CNN Tuesday that the levels of illegal drugs were ""high enough to be classed as environmentally damaging,"" although he added the caveat that levels ""decline pretty quickly after Glastonbury has finished.""Dunn collaborated on the study with Masters student Dan Aberg, who worked alongside Daniel Chaplin, from the Centre for Environmental Biotechnology, to measure levels of illegal drugs in the river before, during and after the last Glastonbury Festival in 2019.Methamphetamine in waterways may be turning trout into addictsRead MoreThe researchers said the increase in drug levels had come from festival goers urinating in public, causing the chemicals to eventually enter the river -- which happens particularly quickly in wet weather conditions. ""This has highlighted the fact that stopping public urination is so important,"" Dunn said. ""Not just for the traditional pollutants, which we've kind of known about, but for these these types of pollutants, which we're only now really just becoming aware of -- pharmaceutical waste, illicit drug waste -- these are important.""Although Dunn praised the work done by the festival to tackle the issue of public urination, he said there was a need for more research to identify the effects of illegal drugs on ecosystems. ""We need to start highlighting the dangers of these drugs to the public and to festival goers and saying, 'look, another reason why you should not be peeing on the ground, go and use the loos, go and use the facilities,'"" he said.Dunn suggested treatment wetlands and reed bed systems could be used to help ""break down and filter out"" pollutants flowing into the river and protect wildlife.The researchers also monitored the nearby Redlake River, but found no significant changes in levels of illegal drugs around the time of the festival -- suggesting the increase was directly linked to Glastonbury Festival.Glastonbury Festival organizers said in a statement to CNN that they had a ""thorough and successful waterways sampling regime"" in place -- agreed with the Environment Agency -- which did not raise any concerns in 2019. However, Dunn told CNN the Environment Agency was ""generally looking for things like ammonia and nitrates and other types of pollutants,"" rather than illegal drugs.""Peeing on the land is something we will continue to strongly discourage at future Festivals. We also do not condone the use of illegal drugs at Glastonbury,"" the festival's statement added.""We are keen to see full details of this new research, and would be very happy to work with the researchers to understand their results and recommendations.""The study was published in the journal Environmental Research earlier this month."

I didn't come to my current vaccination status by studying Black history or watching Donald Trump press conferences.""I have nothing but the utmost respect for every healthcare worker and person in Orlando and all across the board that have worked tirelessly to keep us safe.""Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal, who could not compete at the Tokyo Olympics after being placed in USA Basketball's health and safety protocols, said he doesn't ""feel pressure"" to get the vaccine, ESPN also reported. Following the NBA's caution, CNN learned that the Knicks have fully vaccinated all their players, whereas the Nets and Warriors have yet to do so, or gain exemptions. The NBA denied Golden State Warriors star Andrew Wiggins' request to be exempt from the vaccine for religious reasons, making him ineligible to play home games until he reaches San Francisco's vaccination requirement, the league announced on Friday. The lack of vaccine uptake by some NBA players mirrors a countrywide trend in the US, where the daily pace of new Covid-19 vaccinations is the lowest it has been since mid-January, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention started tracking the data. The seven-day average rate of people getting their first shot is 31% less than last week, and almost 50% less than a month earlier -- with 55% of the total US population fully vaccinated. With this year's NBA season due to start on October 19, questions remain as to whether players across the league will change their stance, or instead forgo competition."

However, speaking ahead of this weekend's clash, Brady was in no mood for sentimentality -- only focus -- as the Buccaneers seek to bounce back from a 34-24 loss to the Los Angeles Rams that ended a 10-game winning streak.""I'm not going to necessarily reminisce,"" Brady told Jim Gray on the 'SiriusXM Let's Go!' podcast.Read More""I don't think this is the moment for that. I'll have plenty of opportunities to reminisce about my football career -- none of it, none of which I really care to do right now because I'm so much in the moment.

I'm excited to go play a football game,"" Brady added.That time for reminiscing may still be a way off too, with the 44-year-old saying earlier this month he could play until 50.Sweet smell of vindicationDespite his reluctance to venture down memory lane, Brady admitted that arriving at a place so familiar, from the other side of the fence, will be a special experience. ""I know that locker room, I know that home locker room, I know that home tunnel, I know which way the wind blows, I know everything about that. I know the way it smells. I know what a night game's like, I know what the fans are going to sound like,"" Brady said.""So, in some ways, that'll be really unique. I've never had that experience going to New England, going to be a first time for me being on the other side-line.""Belichick and Brady congratulate each other after a game against the Indianapolis Colts in 2015.Brady and Belichick's partnership underpinned an unprecedented era of success for the Patriots, simultaneously forging Brady's status as one of the greatest athletes of all time.Since parting ways, Brady has gone on to claim his seventh championship ring -- guiding the Buccaneers to a convincing victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in his first season in Florida -- while Belichick's Patriots, without their legendary signal caller for the first time since 1999, finished the season with a losing record and failed to make the playoffs. Speaking ahead of the game, Tom Brady Sr. did not mince his words when asked if he felt any vindication for his son following his departure from New England.""Damn right,"" Brady Sr. told Tom Curran on the Patriot's Talk podcast.""Belichick wanted him out the door and last year he threw 56 touchdowns. I think that's a pretty good year.""Curran followed up asking, ""Does Brady feel the same way?""""Damn right,"" Brady Sr. answered.'He's a great mentor for me'Brady Jr. was slightly more diplomatic when discussing his former boss.""Well, I have 20 years of being there and obviously he's a great mentor for me,"" Brady said.""I think there's definitely great lessons I've learned from him. He's a great football coach, and he does a great job for his team. And, you know, any player, I think they would just hope that their coaches give them everything they got. ""I'm sure every great coach wants every player to give them everything they got. And I think that's what makes a great relationship.""Following that defeat to the Rams, the Bucs arrive in Foxborough with a 2-1 record, with the Patriots sitting on a 1-2 start to the season.

The previous all-time high was recorded four days ago, on September 24, when 828 deaths were registered. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov acknowledged the country's regions had seen an increase in coronavirus cases while speaking to journalists on Tuesday.  The head of Russia's public health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, said last week it was hard to determine when cases would slow, with less than 50 million Russians having received a first dose of a vaccine. Putin says 'several dozen' in his inner circle test positive for coronavirus""We have, let us say, 110-115 million adults. Of them, some 47 million have received one dose.

It is currently battling a devastating third wave of infections.In total, it has registered 7,464,708 cases across the country, while the total number of coronavirus-related deaths since the beginning of the pandemic now stands at 205,531, according to official figures. CNN has previously reported that the actual toll is believed to be much higher due in part to the way Russia classifies coronavirus deaths.Despite being the first country in the world to approve a coronavirus vaccine, Sputnik V, for use in August 2020, Russia has since lagged behind much of the world when it comes to getting its population inoculated.It is struggling with persistently low vaccination rates -- a problem caused by high levels of hesitancy among its population. Just over a quarter of Russians have received the shot, compared to more than a half in the United States and two thirds in the United Kingdom, according Our World in Data.Russia says people can decline its vaccine. But for many, they'll get fired if they doIn a bid to try and bolster vaccination numbers, Moscow authorities in June ordered that at least 60% of service industries staff -- spanning everything from catering to housing to transport -- had to get at least one shot by mid-July. Peskov said at the time that while vaccination was voluntary, workers were at risk of losing their jobs if they declined a shot. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has been self-isolating in recent weeks after several people in his inner circle tested positive for Covid-19, the Kremlin said on September 14. Putin told a summit of the Collective Security Treaty Organization via video link that ""several dozen people"" from his entourage had contracted the virus.

May 8, 2019. Amsterdam.A flick by Dele Alli sends Lucas Moura racing into the Ajax penalty area. A sweep of a left foot later, and the Brazilian sends an entire fanbase into a state of delirium.Moura's second-half hat-trick has just completed one of the all-time famous European comebacks -- having been 0-3 down with less than half a match to play, his goal in the sixth minute of injury time has just sent Tottenham Hotspur to its first ever Champions League final.  Talismanic manager Mauricio Pochettino tearfully embraces his staff and players. Close to the fifth anniversary of his arrival at Spurs, the Argentine has taken the club from the Europa League to Champions League regulars. Overcome with emotion, he sinks to his knees.Lucas Moura celebrates his dramatic third goal in the Champions League semifinal second leg against Ajax.17:04 BST. September 26, 2021. London. Over two years later.Read MoreHarry Kane sinks to his knees as Bukayo Saka fires Arsenal into a three-goal lead over their arch rivals with barely half an hour played.As stone-faced manager Nuno Espirito Santo watches on, staring down the barrel of a third consecutive 3-0 league defeat to a fellow London club, some Spurs fans have already begun heading for the exit at the Emirates Stadium.A consolation goal by Son Heung-Min in the closing stages makes the scoreline marginally less embarrassing, but Spurs have been comprehensively outplayed by an Arsenal side who had begun the campaign with three straight defeats.In just over two years, Tottenham have fallen from arguably the most joyous night in their recent history to the worst fate imaginable -- being swept aside by their greatest rivals.Spurs ultimately came up short in that 2019 Champions League final, falling 2-0 to Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool in Madrid, a result that many have since earmarked as the team's breaking point.Yet the damage was done long before that night, with Spurs currently enduring what Jack Pitt-Brooke of the Athletic described this morning as a ""capitulation ... years in the making.""No furnitureNostalgia is never stronger than at times of struggle, and rarely a day goes by right now without seeing Spurs fans reminisce of the team that clocked up 86 points in the 2016/17 season -- a tally that would have seen them win the league by five points over Leicester the year before.Unfortunately for Spurs, a rampant 93-point season by Antonio Conte's Chelsea denied the North Londoners a first Premier League crown, but there was a sense among fans that, under Pochettino, the club was on the path to success. With the right investment, Spurs could finally get over the line.Kane celebrates scoring his side's first goal against Arsenal in November 2016.The following season, Spurs ran riot in a 4-1 dismantling of Liverpool. Nine of the eleven players that Pochettino started that day lined up for the Champions League final against Liverpool in Madrid two years later.For Liverpool? Just four.Understandably masked by that incredible Champions League run, it is easy to forget just how poor Tottenham's form was in the second half of the 2018/19 season.Having made an excellent start, the end of February marked the beginning of a seismic collapse -- Pochettino's side winning just three of their final 12 league matches, scoring a mere six, and scraping a top four finish on the final day of the season.They were not the first, nor will they be the last, to embark on a dazzling cup run despite sub-par league form. Chelsea's two Champions League triumphs in 2012 and 2021 were marked by sixth and fourth placed finishes respectively, far from the domestic pedigree of supposed European champions.However, it was clear at the time that Spurs were in desperate need of a reboot.Pochettino had worked wonders to take Spurs from a fun team of also-rans to a side that fought for the title for two consecutive seasons between 2015 and 2017, but two years later, he was overseeing an aging squad that he had squeezed the maximum from.The blueprint had already been laid out by their eventual conquerors Liverpool, who had shown the potential glory that could come with acute business and strategy.Having been in a similar position to Pochettino's early Spurs sides just a few years prior, the smart reinvestment of fees from the sales of Raheem Sterling and Phillipe Coutinho into Alisson, Virgil van Dijk, Fabinho and others had transformed Klopp's side into a domestic and European powerhouse. By contrast, Spurs did not buy a single player ahead of that 2018/19 season.""When you talk about Tottenham, everyone says you have an amazing house, but you need to put in the furniture,"" Pochettino said, just days before that famous night in Amsterdam.""If you want to have a lovely house, maybe you need better furniture. And it depends on your budget if you are going to spend money.""Now, it's about creating another chapter and to have the clear idea of how we are going to build that new project. We need to rebuild. It's going to be painful.""A cautionary taleAnd painful it was.In November, following a wretched start to the season, Pochettino was sacked and replaced by former Chelsea hero Jose Mourinho.Tanguy Ndombele, Ryan Sessegnon and Giovani Lo Celso arrived but Spurs had lost two experienced first team players in Christian Eriksen and Kieran Trippier. While a rebuild was needed, Trippier and Eriksen were far from over the hill in terms of age, and it is a cruel irony that both have since gone on to win their domestic leagues in Italy and Spain respectively.A move for Paulo Dybala dramatically collapsed due to an agonizing complication over image rights, a failed transfer that would have served as a huge statement of intent. Bruno Fernandes, now one of Manchester United's main men and one of the league's best players, was also reportedly a key priority for Spurs that failed to materialize.Mauricio Pochettino applauds the fans after a UEFA Champions League group match against Crvena Zvezda in November 2019.It remains to be seen whether Ndombele, Sessegnon and Lo Celso will reap long-term benefit for Spurs, but the damage had already been done. Granted, they may not have the financial muscles that the likes of Chelsea and the two Manchester clubs -- United and City -- regularly flex, but a series of poor recruitment windows have seen Spurs fail to capitalize on the momentum built by Pochettino.In an end of season letter to fans in May, chairman Daniel Levy admitted that the club had ""lost sight"" of key priorities.""I have said it many times and I will say it again -- everything we do is in the long-term interests of the club. I have always been and will continue to be ambitious for our club and its fans,"" wrote Levy.""As a club we have been so focused on delivering the stadium and dealing with the impact of the pandemic, that I feel we lost sight of some key priorities and what's truly in our DNA. ""Our work in the community and with the NHS is an example of when we get it right, but we don't get everything right. It has never been because we don't care about or respect you, our fans -- nothing could be further from the truth.""StasisLevy's candidness was commendable, and the financial impact of a $1.3 billion new stadium compounded by a global pandemic are certainly mitigating factors worth considering, but much of Levy's credibility in his explanation was immediately undercut by the managerial merry-go-round played out at the club just months later.With Mourinho sacked and caretaker boss Ryan Mason returning to his role in the academy system, Spurs reportedly held talks with both Conte and Paulo Fonseca that both ultimately fell through.Following months of uncertainty, the club finally appointed Espirito Santo at the end of June, giving the Portuguese coach, by all intents and purposes not their first choice appointment, just over a month to prepare for the upcoming campaign.The new manager's arrival was made all the more complicated by the Kane saga of the summer, which served to encapsulate Tottenham's stasis.Having reportedly sought to dive overboard from a sinking ship onto a Manchester City-bound yacht, the failure of this move to materialize has led to the Englishman cutting a dejected figure so far this campaign. Having scored 166 goals in his career, Kane still is yet to find the back of the net this season in the Premier League.Kane announced his plans to stay at the club via Twitter, saying he was ""staying at Tottenham this summer ...100% focused on helping the team achieve success"". The tendency to read into the ominous ""this summer"" choice of phrasing aside, it is difficult not to emphathize with Kane. Having given so much to the club that give him his own break in the first place, he will no doubt be as frustrated as any fan with the club's current predicament. Should Kane's poor form continue, there will no doubt be many in the Spurs hierarchy who regret not cashing in on the forward when they had the chance. There is an alternative universe in which Spurs embarked on a Liverpool inspired, Coutinho-esque rebuild with the Kane funds, but this is not that timeline.As the club slogan goes -- ""To dare is to do"" -- Spurs are paying the price for their failure to dare."

The vote will also make it legal for woman to get an abortion beyond 12 weeks if the pregnancy is life threatening for the woman, or anomalies and malformations of the fetus arise that pose a serious health risk to the woman.Turnout for the referendum was low at 41.11% for the majority Catholic republic.The microstate's Secretary of the Interior, Elena Tonnini, hopes to draft up a law based on the vote as soon as possible, according to public broadcaster San Marino RTV.A woman casts her ballot for the abortion referendum at a polling station in San Marino, on September 26.The referendum result overturned a law dating back to 1865. Read MoreThe vote in the northern Italian enclave of 33,000 people comes as authorities in countries such as Poland and the US state of Texas have tightened abortion laws. Earlier this month, Mexico's Supreme Court ruled that penalizing abortion is unconstitutional.Up to now in San Marino, women who ended their pregnancies risked three years' imprisonment. The term is twice as long for anyone who carries out an abortion.Texas' abortion law is one of the most restrictive in the developed worldSan Marino women wanting an abortion normally went to Italy, where they could only get one privately, at a cost of about 1,500 euros ($1,765).Elsewhere in Europe, the Mediterranean island of Malta, and the micro-states of Andorra and Vatican City, another Italian enclave, still ban abortion.In Europe's last referendum on abortion, the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar voted in June to ease what remain extremely strict curbs. Ireland legalized abortion in a far higher-profile referendum in 2018.Social progress has tended to be slow in San Marino. Women did not get the right to vote until 1960, 14 years after surrounding Italy, and have only been allowed to hold political office since 1974. Divorce was legalized in 1986, some 16 years after Italy. Additional reporting by Reuters."

Monday is the ninth consecutive day of eruptions from the volcano, which has so far forced the evacuation of nearly 6,000 people, destroyed hundreds of homes and ravaged the island's economically crucial banana plantations. Reuters drone footage showed a rapid river of red hot lava flowing down the slopes of the crater, passing close to homes, and swathes of land and buildings engulfed by a black mass of slower-moving, older lava.The flow of lava has engulfed more than 230 hectares, the European Union satellite monitoring service Copernicus said, swallowing hundreds of houses as well as roads, schools and churches, and forcing thousands to evacuate.No fatalities or serious injuries have been reported since the volcano's eruption, but about 15% of the island's banana crop could be at risk, jeopardizing thousands of jobs.Additional reporting by Reuters."

After Merkel's election win in September 2017, it took more than five months for a government to be formed. Read MoreThough the preliminary count gives the SPD a small lead over its closest rivals, the results mark a significant improvement for the party that took 20.5% of the vote in the last election in 2017.Germany is the biggest economy in Europe. What if it shifts left?As votes were counted, party leader Olaf Scholz called the outcome a ""great success.""""Many citizens have put their crosses next to the SPD because they want there to be a change in government and also because they want the next chancellor of this country to be called Olaf Scholz,"" he said.The 63-year-old politician has served as the vice-chancellor and German finance minister in Merkel's grand coalition government since 2018, earning him increased visibility as he navigated Germany's economic response to the pandemic.""Now we will await the final result, but then we will get to work. Thank you!"" Scholz said. Loud applause and cheering from jubilant party supporters interrupted him as he spoke. Robin Fugmann, 20, an ardent Scholz supporter, told CNN he was delighted by the results. ""It is really an amazing result, people believe in Olaf Scholz, people believe that Armin Laschet really cannot lead this country,"" he said.

Now they wonder who'll fill the void""We can foresee that there could be a government with three parties,"" he said, as he said the party would ""do everything to try to build a coalition.""Laschet added that the CDU had ""got a mandate against a leftist government.""The party had campaigned on a message of stability for the country after Merkel, seen as a steady pair of hands over the past nearly 16 years, steps down. But it is now coming to terms with what it itself called a bitter night of losses.""When we look at how we lost compared to the last election, it is bitter for us,"" CDU secretary-general Paul Ziemiak told CNN in an interview at party headquarters.""But it is also clear that after the numbers there is not yet a clear view about who is ahead and exactly how,"" he said. ""The question is, who can form a stable government, form a coalition for the future, for this country? We have many issues to tackle -- climate protection, innovation -- but we also have to ensure stability and social security, which I believe a coalition of the CDU/CSU, the Greens and the FDP could do well, and that is what we will be talking about over the next few days.""The CDU's Peter Altmaier, who has been serving as the federal Minister of Economic Affairs and Energy, told CNN that the election result was ""in no way a landslide victory for the opposition parties"" and showed ""a lot of confidence"" in the CDU to govern.Reflecting on the election, he added: ""The clear message to all the people around the globe is that democracy in Germany is quite stable, this was not the day of extremist parties -- not from the left, not from the right -- it was the day of the conventional parties from the center of our democracy.""Deborah Piraba, a 27-year-old law student and Young Christian Union Democrat, told CNN at the CDU headquarters that the results were ""disappointing"".""We have to consider that we are coming out of 16 years with Angela Merkel, whom I am a big fan of. I am already sad she is leaving the office,"" she said. ""We call her Mutti (Mom), she knew how to talk to people and has the connection with people and she has done so much for Germany. This made her so special comparing her with other politicians. I will also miss her sense of humor.""German Chancellor Angela Merkel stands as leading CDU members applaud on Sunday.Greens 'wanted more'Meanwhile, the crowd at the Green party headquarters in Berlin cheered as the first exit polls were read out.Later, preliminary results gave the party 14.8% of votes.""We have led a campaign as we have never before experienced in this country -- around the clock, until last night, the last second,"" said Greens' leader Annalena Baerbock as she thanked party supporters. Environmental concerns and economic worries emerged as key issues in campaigning, with the former fueled by the deadly floods that devastated parts of Germany this summer.Baerbock credited her party's success to young and new voters. ""This momentum from the market places, from so many [people] who joined our party in the last years, has led to this historical best result,"" she said.But, Baerbock added, the party had ""wanted more"" and had failed to do better in part because of mistakes by her during campaigning.The AfD's lead candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, put on a brave face after projected election results showed support for the far-right party dropping by 2.6% from 2017.""We are in the double figures, we have been able to assert ourselves,"" she said, according to Reuters. ""This assertion that we would be gone from parliament after one legislative period has utterly failed and we are very very happy.""Analyst: 'Tall order' to bring parties togetherThe outgoing government remains in office as acting government until it is replaced by a new government. Merkel, 67, will then stand down and the new chancellor will take the reins.Even if the final result changes the vote distribution, the basic fact is ""after 16 years in power, almost 76% of Germans have not voted"" for Merkel's party, CNN commentator Dominic Thomas said.Neither CDU nor SPD will have a real opportunity to create a coalition, he added.""If it is the SPD that leads the way, the only path forward is going to be speaking to three parties that most likely will involve the Greens and the FDP. And that's quite a tall order trying to just bring all of those together,"" he said.The exit polls indicate movement toward center and center-left, he added, reflecting the concerns of a younger electorate.""It is clear that the momentum is moving more towards issues that concern social welfare, green politics,"" Thomas said.CNN's Frederik Pleitgen, Salma Abdelaziz, Nadine Schmidt and Stephanie Halasz reported from Berlin and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

Leaders of the G20, which includes Australia, will be convening in Rome a day ahead of the climate talks. While it is not yet confirmed if Morrison will be at that summit, many G20 leaders are likely to take the short flight from the Italian capital to COP26 in Scotland.""We haven't made any final decisions about (attending COP26). I mean it is another trip overseas and I've been on several this year and spent a lot of time in quarantine,"" Morrison told the West Australian newspaper.Australia is shaping up to be the villain of COP26 climate talksMorrison said he needed to focus on the country's reopening after an extended lockdown. His government is aiming to relax its hardline border restrictions in December. ""Australia will be opening up around that time, there will be a lot of issues to manage and I have to manage those competing demands,"" he said. Read MoreThe Prime Minister made his comments as Australia comes under pressure from allies, including the United States, to announce more ambitious pledges on the climate crisis. The country is the world's second-biggest exporter of coal and the Morrison government has said it will continue to mine, export and use the fossil fuel well beyond 2030.Leaders including COP26 President Alok Sharma and UN Secretary-General António Guterres have called on the developed world to end the use of coal by the end of this decade. Morrison's office did not immediately respond to CNN's questions on the Prime Minister's plans for COP26. ""I am bringing the Government and I hope the country together on where we are seeking to go and we are working though our commitments, we are working through our plans ... a plan gives people certainty about the big change that will occur over the next 20-30 years,"" Morrison told the West Australian.An aerial view of the Russel Vale Coal Mine in Wollongong, Australia. The Australian government has been promising a new long-term emissions plan ahead of the talks for months. Morrison made no announcements on any new plans on Friday when he addressed the UN General Assembly in New York in a pre-recorded video. He has said that the country's plan will focus on ""tech not taxes.""Australia is one of just a handful of countries that did not increase its target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when registering its official update on its climate plans to the UN last year. It sent its update on December 31 with little fanfare, keeping its target to a 26-28% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, from 2005 levels. The Australian Climate Council, which is independent of the government, has suggested the country should slash emissions by 75% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels, to do its part in containing global warming to 1.5 degrees. More than 190 countries signed up to the Paris Agreement in 2015, in which they committed to trying to contain global warming to 2 degrees, but preferably 1.5 degrees, above pre-industrial levels to stave off the more catastrophic impacts of the climate crisis. Australia's target sits well below those made by the US, European Union and UK, among other developed nations.Pressure growing on AustraliaSpeaking to Australia's ABC radio on Monday, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne confirmed ""no final decision has been made"" on whether Morrison would attend the talks or whether she would stand in his place, but said Australia ""will be strongly represented"" at COP26 ""no matter which senior Australian representative"" attends.""One thing we are absolutely committed to, as we have said, is setting out our long-term emissions reduction plan prior to the COP and that is what we are focused on as a government,"" Payne said in the interview.What is COP26? How the pivotal UN conference could avert global climate 'catastrophe'Australia is becoming increasingly isolated on the world stage because of its climate failings. US officials pressed Australian ministers on their country's climate record at a recent defense meeting in Washington, mentioning the ""urgency"" of the ""climate crisis"" in a communiqué that Morrison signed.Members of the EU Parliament have told CNN in recent weeks that Australia has one of the worst climate records of all developed nations and some expressed incredulity when it emerged that Australian negotiators had pressured the UK into dropping key climate commitments from their bilateral trade agreement. And comments from Australia's resources minister Keith Pitt dismissing the UN as a ""foreign body"" that should stay out of Australia's affairs has only worsened the country's image as an uncooperative player in climate action. COP26 comes at a crucial time for the world's efforts on the climate crisis. A state-of-the-science report published by the UN in August showed that the world is warming faster than scientists previously thought, and that slashing greenhouse gas emissions by at least half this decade is crucial to staving off the more catastrophic impacts of climate change.Australia is already experiencing more heat extremes and higher sea level rises than the global average because of the crisis. Heat, sea level rise and drought are all projected to increase in Australia the more the Earth warms, the report found.CNN's Ivana Kottasová and Chandler Thornton contributed to this report."

Everard went missing after leaving a friend's house in Clapham, south London, on March 3, and her disappearance sparked an outpouring across social media from women sharing their own experiences of sexual assault and harassment. A Metropolitan Police officer later pleaded guilty to murdering her.Klingler said the murder of Nessa showed nothing has changed in the six months since Everard was killed in March. ""Violence against women is not [in] the top three priorities of any police department in England or Wales. We don't even rank. Nobody is taking this seriously,"" she said.The British government in July unveiled a new plan to tackle violence against women and girls. But campaigners have said it doesn't go far enough.

The newly discovered species, Archaehierax sylvestris, is one of the oldest eagle-like raptors in the world, according to a study published Monday in the peer-reviewed journal, Historical Biology. Paleontologists from Adelaide's Flinders University unearthed the fossil in March 2016 on a remote outback cattle station during a research trip at Lake Pinpa in South Australia.Archaehierax is the largest eagle known to have lived in Australia during the Oligocene period, which dates back about 33.9 million to 23 million years ago, the study said. It was smaller and more slender than the wedge-tailed eagle, Australia's largest bird of prey, according to the Western Australian Museum. With feet nearly 15 centimeters (6 inches) long, the eagle would have had the ability to grasp large prey. The scientists said it would have hunted an extinct species of koala, which was about the same size as those alive today, as well as possums and other animals in trees, the study said.

The completeness of the skeleton allowed researchers to determine where it fits on the eagle family tree, Mather said. ""It shows a range of features unlike any seen among modern hawks and eagles,"" she said. ""It seems to have been its own unique branch of the eagle family.""The fossil bones reveal that the wings of the species were short for its size, which made them quite agile and allowed them to dodge trees while it hunted. Its legs were relatively long, which would have given it considerable reach.Scientists did not say why or when the species went extinct. The Australian environment during the Oligocene was vastly different to today. Lake Pinpa, where the fossil was found, was once a lush ecosystem covered in trees and forests, the study said. Today, it is barren, dry and desolate. Flinders University palaeontologist Warren Handley at a dig site near Lake Pinpa, South Australia.Trevor Worthy, associate professor at Flinders University and co-author of the study, said in the statement that it is rare to find even one bone from a fossil eagle. This is likely due to a number of reasons, Mather added, including that bird bones can be quite fragile, which makes them easier to break. ""To have most of the skeleton is pretty exciting, especially considering how old it is,"" Worthy said. Researchers have made a number of fossil discoveries in Australia over the years, shedding light on the diversity of species that roamed the Earth eons ago. Most recently, scientists discovered that there once was a species of flying ""dragon"" that soared over Australia 105 million years ago. The pterosaur was described by researchers as a ""fearsome beast"" who snacked on juvenile dinosaurs. In June, scientists confirmed that the 2007 discovery of a fossilized skeleton in the state of Queensland was Australia's largest dinosaur. The dinosaur, nicknamed ""Cooper,"" stood at about two stories tall, and was a as long as a basketball court."

But the haggling could take days, weeks, or even longer -- it took months for a government to be formed after Merkel's 2017 election win.Here are some key takeaways from the historic vote:Worst ever result for Merkel's partyMerkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) had its worst ever showing, posting record losses. Together with its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU) it notched up 24.1% of the vote, compared to the SPD's 25.7%, and lost 49 seats in total; the CSU lost one other seat (the SPD gained 51 seats).CDU leader Armin Laschet's campaign faltered after a series of gaffes. Read MoreCDU leader Armin Laschet, whose ratings dipped towards the end of the campaign following a number of gaffes, told supporters the party ""cannot be content with this result,"" but insisted his party would ""do everything to try to build a coalition.""Supporters had argued that a vote for the CDU represented stability for the country once Merkel -- seen as a steady pair of hands for years -- steps down, but the result is a bitter one for the chancellor's party.A big night for the GreensAnnalena Baerbock's party, the Greens, has emerged as one of two kingmakers in Germany's coalition talks.Climate was one of the key issues on the campaign trail -- particularly after deadly floods devastated areas of western Germany over the summer -- and that played to the Greens' advantage.The party scored 14.8% of the vote, gaining 51 seats.Its co-chair, Annalena Baerbock, a former professional trampolinist, credited her party's success to attracting young and new voters.""This momentum from the marketplaces, from so many [people] who joined our party in the last years, has led to this historical best result,"" she told crowds of supporters at the party's headquarters on Sunday night.But Baerbock added that the Greens had ""wanted more"" and had aimed to become the ruling party; early in the campaign the Greens held a brief lead over both main traditional parties, CDU and SPD.On Monday, Baerbock said the party was ""open for talks with other German parties,"" adding: ""We have received a clear mandate from the voters to ensure a new beginning for our country.""FDP and Greens likely kingmakers The Greens now look set to play a kingmaker role in any coalition -- alongside the liberal, business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP), who secured 11.5% of the vote, and gained 12 seats on top of their 2017 performance.The FDP has never led a German government but has been the junior partner in coalitions with both the CDU and the SPD in the past.Its leader, Christian Lindner, said Monday that exploratory talks have already begun with the Greens: ""There are the greatest differences in content between the Greens and the FDP ... therefore it makes sense that ... we should look for common ground,"" he told reporters in Berlin.Lindner also said his party was ready to talk to the SPD and the CDU.Merkel's seat flipsAngela Merkel will step down as Germany's chancellor once a new coalition deal is agreed and her replacement is confirmed.In a night marked by a series of bitter blows for the CDU, perhaps the most telling was the loss of Angela Merkel's own seat.The outgoing chancellor's constituency -- Stralsund, in northeast Mecklenburg-Vorpommern -- flipped to SPD candidate Anna Katharina Kassautzki, a 27-year-old who works at the University of Greifswald.Kassautzki told CNN that Merkel leaves behind big shoes to fill. ""She has done a lot for the constituency here and I think she was also often a strong chancellor and a role model for us -- especially for young girls,"" said Kassautzki.Merkel showed that ""women can also be in politics, women can also have power,"" added Kassautzki. ""Just creating visibility like that was very important.""Far-right gains in former East GermanyGermany's far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany, the AfD party, lost 11 seats overall, but came out on top in the eastern states of Thuringia and Saxony.The AfD, which has pledged to barricade the nation against Europe's open borders, won its first seats in the Bundestag in 2017, following Angela Merkel's decision to welcome more than one million migrants into the country. Its nationalist message has struck a chord in parts of the former East Germany, but the party has largely been shut out by Germany's mainstream political parties.Earlier this year, the AfD was placed under surveillance by the country's intelligence service, on suspicion of trying to undermine Germany's democratic constitution.CNN's Sugam Pokharel, Jennifer Deaton and Helen Regan contributed to this report.

Both the SPD and the CDU with its coalition partner, the Christian Social Union (CSU), have said they want to begin coalition negotiations to form a new government.The tight result means that two smaller parties -- the Green Party, which took 14.8% of the votes, and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), with 11.5% -- will be the likely kingmakers. ""After potentially lengthy 'sounding out' talks, these two parties will either team up to put Olaf Scholz (the SPD leader) or -- slightly less likely -- Armin Laschet (of CDU/CSU) into the chancellor's office,"" said German expert Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank.Read MoreMerkel, who over 16 years cemented her position as one of the world's most successful political leaders, will stay in job until a coalition deal is negotiated -- and that could take months.After Merkel's election win in September 2017, it took more than five months for a government to be formed. If that situation were to repeat itself, the new government wouldn't form until after Christmas and Merkel would surpass Helmut Kohl as the longest serving chancellor of post-war Germany. SPD leader Olaf Scholz waves to supporters at the party's headquarters in Berlin, on September 26.'Traffic light coalition'Though the preliminary count gives the SPD a small lead over its closest rivals, the results mark a significant improvement for the party that took 20.5% of the vote in the last election in 2017.Scholz said this proved that German voters wanted him to be next chancellor. ""Many citizens have put their crosses next to the SPD because they want there to be a change in government and also because they want the next chancellor of this country to be called Olaf Scholz,"" he said in remarks at his party's headquarters.On Monday, he confirmed he will be seeking to build a coalition with the Greens and the FDP, dubbed ""the Traffic Light"" by German press, in reference to the official colors of the three parties.Meet Olaf Scholz, the man who might replace Angela Merkel as Germany's next chancellor ""It is quite clear that you can deduct a mandate to govern, a  government that is sustainable, and is sustained by the parties that have won, the SPD being one of them. That's the Green party and the FDP. And hence we are going to try to forge away along those lines,"" Scholz said.The 63-year-old politician has served as the vice-chancellor and German finance minister in Merkel's grand coalition government since 2018, earning him increased visibility as he navigated Germany's economic response to the Covid-19 pandemic.By contrast, the CDU leader Laschet told supporters that his party ""cannot be content with this result,"" while noting that the final result remained unclear.""We can foresee that there could be a government with three parties,"" he said, adding that his party would ""do everything to try to build a coalition.""Laschet added that the CDU had ""got a mandate against a leftist government.""While both of the main parties rejected the idea of continuing to govern together as a coalition, Laschet is hoping he could lure the Greens and the FDP to work with him instead of the SPD and form a ""Jamaica Coalition,"" another nickname based on the party colors.  The CDU had campaigned on a message of stability for the country after Merkel, seen as a steady pair of hands over the past nearly 16 years, steps down. But it is now coming to terms with what it itself called a bitter night of losses. Merkel's own seat in northeast Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has flipped to the Social Democrats after the outgoing chancellor held it for 31 years.Merkel's constituency flipped to Anna Katharina Kassautzki, a 27-year-old who works at the University of Greifswald.Kassautzki told CNN that Merkel leaves behind big shoes to fill. ""She has done a lot for the constituency here and I think she was also often a strong chancellor and a role model for us -- especially for young girls,"" said Kassautzki.Merkel showed that ""women can also be in politics, women can also have power,"" added Kassautzki. ""Just creating visibility like that was very important.""SPD members react to initial election results in Berlin on Sunday.Meanwhile, Greens' leader Annalena Baerbock said her party ""led a campaign as we have never before experienced in this country -- around the clock, until last night, the last second.""Environmental concerns and economic worries have emerged as key issues in campaigning, with the former fueled by the deadly floods that devastated parts of Germany this summer.Baerbock credited her party's success to young and new voters. ""This momentum from the market places, from so many [people] who joined our party in the last years, has led to this historical best result,"" she said.Germany is the biggest economy in Europe. What if it shifts left?But, Baerbock added, the party had ""wanted more"" and had failed to do better in part because of her mistakes during campaigning. The Greens had big ambitions going into the vote, with some polls earlier this year showing them as having a chance of winning. When they announced Baerbock would be running for chancellor, it was the first time the party put forward an official candidate for the post.""The Greens can be happy that they've improved in terms of results since the last election cycle, but they definitely did not fulfill expectations,"" said Sudha David-Wilp, the deputy director of the Berlin office of the German Marshall Find of the United States.""Baerbock didn't meet the moment. At one point, the party was leading the pack, there were far greater expectations for them,"" David-Wilp added.The AfD's lead candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, put on a brave face after exit polls showed a drop in support for the far-right party. Preliminary official results put the count at 10.3% of the vote, down from 12.6% in 2017.""We are in the double figures, we have been able to assert ourselves,"" she said, according to Reuters. ""This assertion that we would be gone from parliament after one legislative period has utterly failed and we are very very happy.""David-Wilp said the far right's losses were likely down to the party's performance during their first term in the parliament. ""There was definitely a hullabaloo four years ago when the AfD became the largest opposition force in the Bundestag, but they've definitely had a lot of infighting, which hasn't helped the party's trajectory and right now, looking at the landscape, they seem to be more of a regional party in the former East,"" she said. 'We'll miss her'Robin Fugmann, 20, an ardent Scholz supporter, told CNN he was delighted by the results so far.""It is really an amazing result, people believe in Olaf Scholz, people believe that Armin Laschet really cannot lead this country,"" he said. ""So we really have the mandate to lead a new government -- I hope we will do so. And first of all we are going to celebrate because this is a really amazing result.""Angela Merkel saw Germans through crisis after crisis. Now they wonder who'll fill the voidDeborah Piraba, a 27-year-old law student and Young Christian Union Democrat, told CNN at the CDU headquarters that the results were ""disappointing"" but that nothing was lost yet.""We have to consider that we are coming out of 16 years with Angela Merkel, whom I am a big fan of. I am already sad she is leaving the office,"" she said. ""We call her Mutti (Mom), she knew how to talk to people and has the connection with people and she has done so much for Germany. This made her so special comparing her with other politicians. I will also miss her sense of humor.""CNN's Salma Abdelaziz, Nadine Schmidt, Stephanie Halasz and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to reporting and writing."

In one of the most dramatic endings to a game in recent years, Tucker converted a 66-yard field goal -- with the ball first bouncing off the crossbar before finally going through the posts -- as time expired to enter the NFL history books and help the Ravens beat the Detroit Lions 19-17.

I hop into it just a little more aggressively.""It capped off a remarkable final sequence for the Ravens, after quarterback Lamar Jackson converted a fourth-and-19 with a 36-yard pass to Sammy Watkins with less than a minute left and no timeouts remaining to set up Tucker's kick. Lions fans must be sick of the sight of Tucker by now, as it's been eight years since he hit a 61-yard game-winning field goal to beat the same team. ""It's déjà vu all over again,"" Tucker said.

Now world's crisis manager steps down - CNN",Angela Merkel endured as others came and went. Now world's crisis manager steps down,"(CNN)It's a lesson many politicians -- mostly male -- have learned the hard way over the past 15 years: never underestimate Angela Merkel. The German Chancellor is preparing to step down later this year, having long ago cemented her position as one of the world's most successful political leaders. In her time in office, she has dealt with five UK prime ministers, four French presidents and seven Italian prime ministers. When President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Wednesday, he'll be the fourth American commander-in-chief she's worked with. How Angela Merkel went from lame duck to global leader on coronavirusYet despite her track record, Merkel, the leader of the world's fourth-biggest economy, has spent much of her political career having to prove herself. Her counterparts have tried to overpower or even humiliate her. Vladimir Putin once brought a Labrador dog into his meeting with the Chancellor who is famously afraid of dogs. Donald Trump told her she was stupid. Silvio Berlusconi once left her waiting for 15 minutes while he chatted on the phone.Read MoreWhen she became the first woman to take Germany's top job in 2005, many deemed her too inexperienced and uncharismatic to last. Bild, Germany's most-read newspaper, marked the occasion with a front-page photo and a headline reading ""Miss Germany!"" Even within her own party, she was referred to as ""das Mädchen,"" German for ""the girl."" But while other leaders have come and gone over the intervening years, Merkel has endured, enjoying an unparalleled popularity. ""Das Mädchen"" became nicknamed ""die Mutti,"" a mother figure and symbol of stability.Political scientist Joyce Mushaben, said Merkel was seen as a ""temporary"" leader when she first rose through the ranks of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party.Many of her male rivals had been mired in scandal, and there was a feeling that ""she was just going to be holding that place until they could find a real CDU man to replace her,"" Mushaben said. ""They completely underestimated her learning ability."" Merkel ended up leading the party for 18 years, stepping down in late 2018. It soon became clear just how difficult it will be to replace her. Merkel's handpicked successor Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer lasted just over a year, struggling to keep the regional fractions of the party in line.This weekend, the party picked Armin Laschet as her successor. Laschet, a long time Merkel ally currently serving as the Minister-president of the federal state of North-Rhine Westphalia, won with 52.79% (521 votes), beating Friedrich Merz, a corporate lawyer, who obtained 47.21% (466 votes). Laschet will lead the party into the federal election in September. His election was a clear vote in favor of the continuation of Merkel's moderate politics. Mushaben, a Merkel biographer and professor of comparative politics and gender studies at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said the key to Merkel's success lay in the unique mix of her background and her abilities. Her experience of growing up as a pastor's daughter in Communist East Germany has deeply influenced her political decision-making, and as a former scientist with a doctorate in quantum chemistry, she often approaches problems in the same way as complex calculations, Mushaben said. When her political mentor Helmut Kohl became tangled in a corruption scandal in 1999, she publicly denounced him and called for him to go, despite having been his long-time protege. Merkel pleads with Germans to avoid a 'last Christmas with the grandparents,' as country smashes daily death record""People saw her as a person of integrity, someone who didn't just grab the mic and shoot off her mouth, but someone who waited until she really had something to say,"" Mushaben added.As well as being the first woman to become chancellor, Merkel was also the first politician from the former East Germany to take the post following the fall of the Berlin Wall. Merkel referenced this part of her background recently, when pushing for more coronavirus restrictions, admitting that as someone who sees the freedom to travel as a hard-won right, she was uneasy about the new rules, but explained why they were necessary.Corinna Hoerst, senior fellow and deputy director at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels, said Merkel has been a new type of leader. ""She exudes empathy, stability and reliability,"" Hoerst said. ""That's unique and it has redefined, in some ways, what people are looking for in a leader, because it's so opposed to any of the sort of male stereotypes that we had.""The world's crisis managerEven her staunchest critics admit that Merkel has special powers when it comes to handling crises, having seen Germany through the global financial crisis, the Eurozone debt crisis, and the immigration crisis; with months to go before she steps down, she remains at the forefront of the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. She has often acted as the voice of reason, and as a maker of deals. Political scientists describe her as ""calm,"" ""pragmatic,"" and ""diplomatic."" Some might even add ""boring"" to the mix.""There's nothing glamorous about her,"" said Gabriele Abels, a professor of comparative politics at the University of Tübingen, Germany. ""She is very ... matter of fact, very rational and people would never think of her as being corrupt.""Abels said Merkel embodies what most Germans look for in a leader: ""While we sometimes look at other countries which have more of the charismatic leaders, we don't want these for ourselves, we've had enough of that in history.""

He was one of the candidates who ran to replace her.Hide Caption 45 of 45Hoerst said Merkel's particular strength in recent years has been in building consensus and leading from the middle. ""It's kind of funny that women are seen as, you know, 'Oh, she's so emotional,' but actually, it has been the men who are highly emotional, whether it's Boris Johnson or President Trump, while Chancellor Merkel has been diplomatic and determined not just to forge ahead but to get everybody around the idea,"" she said. Merkel's determination to find an agreement has paid off during some of the biggest crises of the past decade. She was able to broker a deal between the Eurozone and Greece, and convinced Russia and Ukraine's top officials to talk to one another.As a former scientist and environmental minister, she also put climate center from the beginning of her leadership. She presided over the very first UN Climate Conference in Berlin and convinced the other leaders of G8 to accept the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions. ""She even got George Bush to admit that there was a climate change problem; she was a great mediator,"" Mushaben said.But the leading by consensus hasn't always worked. Late last year, she struggled to convince the leaders of Germany's federal states to implement stricter nationwide coronavirus restrictions when infection levels began to rise. And as the rotating President of the Council of the European Union in the past six months, she has struggled to find a consensus with Hungary and Poland over their adherence to the EU's rule of law.'We can manage this'There were also times when Merkel didn't go looking for a compromise, most notably in 2015 when she welcomed refugees fleeing conflicts in Syria and elsewhere. ""Politically persecuted people have the right to asylum. We can be proud of the humanity of our Basic Law ... we also grant protection to all those who flee to us from wars,"" she told the German people that summer. ""I put it simply: Germany is a strong country. The motive with which we approach these things must be: We have achieved so much -- we can do it!,"" Merkel said.""To me that's her most memorable moment, that three-week period in 2015 where she made the decision to fight all the people in her cabinet and the chief for the federal police and the border guards, they all said don't do it and she said, 'If we can save the banks, we can save the human beings,'"" Mushaben said.Hoerst agrees that that decision will form a major part of Merkel's legacy.Angela Merkel stands in 'solidarity' with congresswomen attacked by Trump""It was a humanistic thing to do and it was the right thing to do,"" she said. ""She empowered German citizens who felt empathy for refugees but maybe haven't been active, and she gave them the recognition and the support so that locally they organized and opened their houses.""Many criticized the move, particularly after an estimated 1.2 million people arrived in Germany within the next year and half. The large influx initially caused some problems, and boosted far-right anti-immigration parties such as the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). But that sentiment appears to have been temporary -- the AfD has since faded in the polls, and the policy of welcoming in refugees and migrants is starting to pay off economically. Like many other European countries, Germany is facing a demographic time bomb, with too many retirees and not enough workers. According to Germany's Institute for Labor Market and Occupational Research, 49% of the working-age refugees who have arrived in the country since 2013 were employed as of February last year. More than half of those were in skilled jobs and more than two-thirds were in full-time work. Another 17% were in paid training programs and 3% were in paid internships. According to the research, most of the remaining were either studying, actively looking for jobs or on maternity or parental leave. Some 85% have taken German language courses.In this photo provided by the German Government Press Office, Merkel deliberates with Trump on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Charlevoix, Canada.What's next?Merkel has repeatedly rejected the idea of running for a fifth term and most commentators believe she will stick to that promise. ""Even her decision to run for the fourth term was very hesitant, but she saw Putin behaving badly and she saw the election of Trump and she said, 'Okay, I'm the only grown up left on the stage,'"" Mushaben said.This time around, Merkel appears determined to step back. ""I don't think she will take up any other position, I think that she will actually retire and just enjoy doing the things she has hardly been able to do in the last 20, 30 years,"" Abels said. According to Mushaben, the outgoing Chancellor has previously said that she is looking forward to spending more time cooking plum cake and her famous potato soup, indicating she isn't planning a big speaking tour or another position. But even if she retires completely, she will continue to influence the world for a long time to come. ""In the future, it will be very difficult to argue that a woman cannot be a successful leader, and that's a very important message to tell,"" Abels said."

Nessa is thought to have been murdered on her short journey through the park, with her body found on Saturday afternoon, close to a nearby community center.""It's just an unending cycle of violence against women and it's really depressing,"" Jamie Klingler, one of the co-founders of the Reclaim These Streets campaign group, told CNN. The group was formed after the assault and murder of 33-year-old Sarah Everard in March. Everard went missing after leaving a friend's house in Clapham, south London, on March 3, and her disappearance sparked an outpouring across social media from women sharing their own experiences of sexual assault and harassment. A Metropolitan Police officer later pleaded guilty to murdering her. Klingler said the murder of Nessa showed nothing has changed in the six months since Everard was killed in March. ""Violence against women is not [in] the top three priorities of any police department in England or Wales. We don't even rank. Nobody is taking this seriously,"" she said.What women see when they look at Gabby PetitoAccording to the safety app WalkSafe, there were 112 violent and sex crimes reported within a 1.5 kilometer (0.9 miles) radius of the park where Nessa was killed, just in July, the most recent month for which police figures are available. ""Right now the [local] council is giving out panic alarms and they're giving out pieces of paper saying you have to walk with somebody ... how is it all on us to protect ourselves rather than on society and the government and the police to keep us alive?"" Klingler said.At the vigil on Friday, Clive Efford, the local MP, said 78 women have died in violent attacks since Everard was murdered in March. Efford said a cultural change needed to take place in the UK. ""Those sexist jokes that just slip off the tongue around the coffee machine, that's where it starts, that's the small steps that create the environment where people feel that they can become violent and aggressive towards women and girls, so if we want to bring about change, we have to live that change and be that change,"" he said to applause from the crowd.Mary Johnson, an Indigenous woman, went missing nearly a year ago. While the FBI recently offered a reward, activists say that's not enoughThe British government in July unveiled a new plan to tackle violence against women and girls. But campaigners have said it doesn't go far enough. Refuge, a charity helping women who are victims of domestic violence, said the plan did not provide adequate funding and missed out on an opportunity to put real changes in place. Manuela Colombini, who has lived in the area for about 15 years, said she felt it was her duty to attend the vigil to express her solidarity with Nessa's family and make her voice heard. ""We want to feel safe. I have two young daughters and I don't want them to grow up and think that they cannot go out in the streets or to a park that is near here where we take our dogs,"" she said. ""It's important to be able to show that we are here and this is not acceptable,"" she said.Most of those who gathered in Kidbrooke on Friday didn't know Nessa personally. Like Colombini, they came because they wanted to support the community, take a stand and ensure her story is not forgotten. When one of the speakers encouraged the crowd to say Nessa's name, they did, the sound of hundreds of voices echoing through the square: ""Sabina Nessa. Sabina Nessa.

","europe, UK and France reheat one of the world's oldest rivalries at a risky time for both - CNN",UK and France reheat one of the world's oldest rivalries at a risky time for both,"London (CNN)In the week that world leaders gathered in New York City for the UN General Assembly, one person's absence cast a long shadow over what was already set to be a tense few days. French President Emmanuel Macron was never going to be at UNGA in person. It was, however, impossible to detach his non-attendance -- even in virtual form -- from the spat that broke out following the submarine deal between Australia, the UK and US (AUKUS), which subsequently saw the Australian government ditch a multi-billion-dollar agreement with France. French officials have been, justifiably, furious. Three of its supposed allies struck a deal behind its back with one reneging on a contract agreed years ago. For a man who has spent his presidency presenting himself as Europe's most serious leader both internally and on the world stage, it was a major embarrassment. Conversely, for Boris Johnson, the man who led the Brexit campaign and has been accused of making his country insular and a global insignificance, this was a hat-trick. Standing shoulder-to-shoulder with US President Joe Biden; agreeing a deal with two nations on opposite sides of the world; poking France in the eye in the process. It's the final point that best explains both the hostile rhetoric that has come out of France and goading language from British over the past week. US President Joe Biden delivers remarks about the AUKUS security initiative on September 15, 2021 at the White House, joined virtually by Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Read MoreWhen France withdrew its ambassadors from Washington DC and Canberra, it elected not to do the same in Britain, which was seen as a snub, of sorts. France's Europe minister called the UK a ""junior partner"" that had accepted its vassalization by the US. Johnson responded to the hostility by saying, tellingly in broken French, that some people need to get a grip and give him a break. ""I just think it's time for some of our dearest friends around the world to 'prenez un grip' about all this, 'donnez-moi un break',"" he said to reporters during his US trip. As childish as all this seems, it could be consequential. France and the UK have long been neighbors who love to hate one another. ""Politics is often as simple as: People like being on one side of a rivalry and love it when they get one over their rival,"" says Rob Ford, professor of politics at the University of Manchester. The past week must have been incredibly difficult for Macron to swallow. Not only did the AUKUS deal undermine France's claim to be Europe's most serious geopolitical player, but Johnson went on to score a series of wins in America -- a meeting in the White House; global leaders supporting his climate goals; an end to the US travel ban. All the while, Macron was absent and scorned. Ford points out that this plays into a particular strength of Johnson's: using undiplomatic language -- ""get a grip"" -- that is likely to cause offense while amusing his domestic audience. French President Emmanuel Macron looks through the periscope of submarine ""Le Terrible"" during a July 4, 2017 visit aboard the vessel. But why would he, or any world leader, want to even risk causing such offense? Bluntly, engaging in a bitter spat politically suits Macron and Johnson rather well right now. First, Macron. Aurelien Mondon, senior lecturer at the University of Bath, explains that this is a ""good opportunity for him to appear statesmanlike"" while France is ""only a few months away from the presidential election. This sets him apart from many other candidates who have very little experience in such matters.""It also helps Macron underscore one of his key objectives: bringing the European Union together on matters such as defense, something that would have been impossible had the UK not voted to leave. ""It's no secret that Macron wants to build up an EU pillar within NATO and the EU to have greater defense capabilities,"" says Emmanuelle Schon Quinlivan, lecturer in European politics at the University of Cork. ""He's now able to use the AUKUS row to say the EU cannot rely on the US or the UK.""She also points out that during the Brexit negotiation process, it was Macron who consistently took the hardest line with the UK and was at times the biggest risk to a Brexit deal.Which brings us to Johnson. ""He is a leader who is arguably at his best when he is fighting an enemy,"" says Ford. ""Post-Brexit, the incentive to play up minor conflicts with France is greater because it can no longer punish us inside the structures of the EU."" However, Ford points out that this could go wrong ""if Macron looks for revenge and wants to make Johnson look stupid."" The most obvious area where he could seek to punish Johnson is by pushing the EU to take legal action over the UK's failure to implement the Northern Ireland Protocol in full. Boris Johnson places his foot on a table during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace in Paris on August 22, 2019. ""If France presses the EU to take Britain to court and Britain retaliates by triggering Article 16 of the protocol -- allowing the UK to take unilateral action -- it would represent a serious escalation in tension,"" says Anand Menon, professor of European politics at King's College London.How likely are things to get out of hand? There is limited good faith between Paris and London right now. And a poor relationship affects lots of important issues between neighbors. The UK government has been working with France to stem the flow of irregular migrants traveling across the English Channel. Julian King, Britain's former ambassador to France, says that without the French incentivized to ""enthusiastically patrol those beaches,"" crossing the Channel becomes ""much easier for those wanting to smuggle people into the UK."" This would be a problem for a government that has taken such a hard stance on migration. US President Joe Biden, President of France, Emmanuel Macron and European Commission Ursula von der Leyen speak after posing for photos during the Leaders official welcome and family photo during the G7 Summit In Carbis Bay, on June 11, 2021 in Carbis Bay, Cornwall.He adds that beyond intergovernmental bilateral issues like defense, political rows can spill into a toxic atmosphere in wider society, which in turn could cause spats that are out of either government's hands -- for example fishing boats ramming each other at sea. ""It's not just the UK where some in the media are ready to whip up bad feeling. Politicians, on both sides, should focus on lowering the temperature, not fanning the flames,"" King says. One consequence of the tumultuous past five years in world politics is a bizarre dynamic of diplomatic competition in Europe. The UK, outside the EU, wants desperately to be the best friend of English-speaking democracies like the US, Australia, Canada and others. Simultaneously, the EU is trying to build its own power base that, while independent of the US, will force Washington and other global players to take it seriously. Despite its best efforts, the 27 member states cannot agree on some of the most basic principles of what this EU Mark Two will be. In this environment, artificial rows are inevitable and, in some cases, useful. What leaders must be careful of, however, is not letting them boil over from performative fluff into policies that are damaging to themselves and others."

But after almost 16 years in the top job, she will step down once it becomes clear who her successor will be.Polling predictions on Saturday suggested the race was too close to call, with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) holding a small but narrowing lead over Merkel's party, the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU).The closeness of the race coupled with Germany's complicated voting system means it could take some time before a winning coalition is formed and the ultimate victor is known.CDU leader Armin Laschet and his wife Susanne vote at a polling station in the city of Aachen on Sunday.Olaf Scholz speaks to reporters after voting at a polling station in Potsdam, eastern Germany, during general elections on September 26.Those lining up as candidates to replace Merkel are Armin Laschet, a long-time ally of Merkel and leader of the CDU since January; Olaf Scholz, leader of the left-leaning SPD; and the Greens' Annalena Baerbock.Read MoreEnvironmental concerns and economic worries have emerged as key issues in campaigning, with the former fueled by the deadly floods that devastated parts of Germany this summer.At his final campaign rally Saturday in Potsdam, Scholz referenced concerns over climate change and said that, if elected, he wanted to agree an increase in the minimum wage to 12 euro ($14) an hour within the first year of government.After voting on Sunday, he told reporters: ""Now I hope that as many citizens as possible will go to the polls and cast their votes and make possible what has become apparent, namely that there will be a very strong result for the SPD. And that the citizens give me the mandate to become the next Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany.""Baerbock cast her vote in her hometown of Potsdam on Sunday afternoon and, in brief comments after, she urged people to cast their votes in order to enter a new era, and emphasized the importance of democracy. Germany's election will decide what life after Merkel looks like. Here's what you need to knowLaschet, meanwhile, held a final campaign rally with Merkel in the city of Aachen on Saturday during which the outgoing chancellor praised his ""passion and heart"" and said the election was about the country remaining ""stable"" and ensuring ""that the youth have a future and we can still live in prosperity.""After voting the following day, Laschet told reporters: ""We all feel that this is a very important federal election, an election that decides the direction of Germany in the next few years, and that is why every vote counts, and that is why I hope everyone will use their right to go to the polls, so that democrats can elect a new government in the end.""It's an exciting day, and because it's down to the wire, and you know that every vote counts, today is probably not about the politicians talking, but the voters,"" he added. ""Not an election day, but a day of the voter, which is always the highest day in democracy.""Merkel, the second-longest serving Chancellor in German history, has been widely seen as a steady pair of hands in the face of challenges including the financial crisis of 2007-2008, Britain's exit from the European Union, and, most recently, the Covid-19 pandemic.She has been a driving force for European cohesion and attempted to maintain close ties with the United States and China.Now, with her departure, a period of unaccustomed uncertainty beckons for Germany, the EU and the wider world, although shifts in Germany's international policy are unlikely to be dramatic.In an unwelcome twist, the European Commission on Friday accused Russia of trying to interfere in European democratic processes through ""malicious cyber activities."" German politicians and officials were among those targeted, an EU official told CNN.Annalena Baerbock, chancellor candidate of the German Greens Party, casts her ballot on September 26, 2021 in Potsdam, Germany. Greens could play kingmakerGerman politics has long been dominated by the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats, who have governed together in a coalition for the past eight years. But other parties have grown in popularity over the past decade as the CDU and SPD have lost ground. Angela Merkel saw Germans through crisis after crisis. Now they wonder who'll fill the voidThis election is particularly close; the CDU and SPD have both held polling advantages, and the Green Party has also emerged as a serious contender. As a result, Baerbock stands to play the role of kingmaker in what are expected to be lengthy coalition negotiations.The far-right AfD also remains a stubborn presence on the political scene, scrapping with the liberal Free Democratic Party for fourth place. Both Laschet and Scholz -- whose parties remain neck-and-neck in the polls -- are familiar figures in German politics. Scholz, 63, has belonged to the SPD since he was 17 and has been serving as the vice-chancellor and German finance minister since 2018, earning him increased visibility as he navigated Germany's economic response to the pandemic.His chief opponent, Laschet, 60, is a long-time Merkel ally and the CDU's deputy leader since 2012. He was selected as the party's candidate in January 2021 after a torturous leadership tussle, and has been premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, since 2017. Voters cast their ballots in the federal parliamentary elections in Berlin, Germany. Long lines form in front of a polling station at a school in Friedrichshain.Baerbock caused a brief sensation in German politics when she surged in the polls early in the campaign, prompting voters to wonder whether she could become the country's first Green chancellor.Some 60.4 million people age 18 and above are eligible to vote in this election, according to figures from Germany's Federal Statistics Office.Each will have two votes to cast -- one for the candidate to represent their constituency, of which there are 299 in the Bundestag, or German parliament, and a second vote for their preferred party. A party's share of ""second votes"" determines the number of seats that party gains in the Bundestag, according to proportional representation.For a party to get into the Bundestag, it must win at least 5% of the second vote.Many Germans have already cast their ballots; the coronavirus pandemic has increased the amount of postal voting that took place before polling day.Kamimura Zoellner, a 32-year-old voter from Berlin, said she would prefer for Germany to stay on course with its current political set-up. ""I do think the current government dealt with the coronavirus crisis reasonably well,"" she told CNN on Sunday.""And if you look at the economy, we are not doing that badly compared to other countries. Our economy didn't collapse during the coronavirus crisis. We had a lot of help from the government ...it really could have turned out much worse.""Zoellner said that while she ""knew at a national level who to vote for,"" she was ""torn"" at a local level. ""We live here in Berlin and local rules and regulations here have a direct impact on our lives -- I do want to see change locally.""CNN's Nadine Schmidt reported from Berlin, while Laura Smith-Spark and Rob Picheta wrote from London.

The American team lead their European visitors 11-5 at Whistling Straits, with just 12 singles matches to come on Sunday. Following a dominant Friday, they won three of Saturday's foursomes, extending their lead to 9-3, the largest lead for either side after three sessions of the Ryder Cup since the US led by 7 points in 1975. Later in Saturday afternoon's fourballs, the Europeans fought back with some gritty golf.

Read MoreHowever, the US team won the other two fourball matches, with Dustin Johnson and Collin Morikawa dominating Ian Poulter and Rory McIlroy, while a late flurry of birdies from Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau were enough to edge past Tommy Fleetwood and Viktor Hovland. Johnson, the two-time major winner, proved his class throughout, becoming the first American player to win a match in each of the first four sessions of the Ryder Cup since Larry Nelson in 1979.While the spirit and fight the European golfers showed in the afternoon session would have given hope to those watching back home, the Americans enter the final day with a nearly insurmountable lead.

World No. 1 Rahm and Garcia picked up Europe's only point of the morning session, beating Koepka and Daniel Berger 3&1.The scoreboard was predominately red from there, with a clean sweep of US victories in the other three foursome matches. Johnson and Morikawa beat Paul Casey and Hatton 2&1, Justin Thomas and Spieth edged Hovland and Bernd Wiesberger and Xander Schauffele and Patrick Cantlay beat Lee Westwood and Matt Fitzpatrick. That left the US with a six-point advantage heading into the final session of Saturday, and with things looking ominous for the Europeans. But soon after the foursome session began, it became clear whatever Harrington said in the break had the desired effect on his players. Shane Lowry played like a man inspired, getting three birdies in the opening three holes while the Spanish pairing of Rahm and Garcia -- who have been so productive for Team Europe -- rushed out to a three-shot lead over Koepka and Spieth.Lowry and Hatton celebrate their win over English and Finau on the 18th green.In both matches, the US duo worked their way back slowly, but in the end, the Europeans were just able to hold out, gaining vital points.In the third pairing of the afternoon's foursomes, the advantange swung between the two sides, of Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau of the US and Tommy Fleetwood and Hovland of Europe.

Her body was found a week later, more than 50 miles from where she was last seen. Her killer, a serving police officer, pleaded guilty to her kidnap, rape and murder.London police officer pleads guilty to murder of Sarah EverardHer murder prompted an outpouring across social media from women sharing their own experiences of sexual assault and harassment, catapulting the UK's damning record on violence against women and girls into the national spotlight.More than 200 women were killed between March 2019 and 2020 in the UK, according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and the Scottish government.Following Nessa's death, many are pointing out that little has changed. In a message posted to Twitter on Wednesday, Women's Equality Party leader Mandu Reid said: ""The media have been asking today: have things gotten better since Sarah Everard's murder? The answer is NO.""Nessa left her home in Kidbrooke around 8:30 p.m. on September 17, to meet a friend at a nearby pub, police said. The journey, which took Nessa through a public park, should have taken just over five minutes. But she never made it to her destination. Nessa's body was discovered in the park the next day.In the week since Nessa's murder, the national conversation has refocused on the lack of safety for women in public spaces, which further deteriorated during the coronavirus pandemic and associated lockdowns. And, once again, campaigners, politicians and Britons are demanding that the government tackle the epidemic of violence against women and girls.Police released this image of a silver car in the Pegler Square area that they believe a man they are searching for has access to.A survey conducted this summer by the ONS found that two out of three women aged 16- to 34-years-old had experienced some form of harassment in the previous 12 months. One in two women felt unsafe walking alone after dark in a quiet street near their home, according to ONS.British politicians including London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Member of Parliament Janet Daby, who represents the borough where Nessa taught, have demanded that the government act swiftly to save lives.""We do have an epidemic when it comes to violence against women and girls,"" Khan said in an interview with British broadcaster ITV on Thursday, calling for misogyny to be made a hate crime under British law and to criminalize harassment of women in public spaces.Addressing Parliament on Wednesday, Daby said that Nessa's life had been brutally taken ""like so many before her, through misogynistic violence.""""How many women's lives most be stolen before this government takes serious action?"" she said.Sarah Everard's case reminds women of what they already knew: They're never safeOne woman is killed by a man on average every three days in the UK, according to data from the Femicide Census, an organization that tracks violence against women and girls. The group argues that the government's new strategy to curb such violence ""shamefully ignores"" victims of femicide.On Thursday, Greenwich Council told CNN that they had handed out 200 personal alarms to women and vulnerable residents in the borough this week ""following the horrific murder of Sabina Nessa.""The small device can be attached to keys and handbags or held, and activate a loud alarm in the event of an attack, a Greenwich Council spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the alarms have been distributed at events since 2019.But activists stress that women shouldn't have to be on the defense. A report from a police watchdog in July said that ""radical,"" cross-sector reform is needed to protect women and girls from an ""epidemic"" of crime.Anna Birley, from the women's safety organization Reclaim These Streets, which is assisting the Kidbrooke community with Friday's vigil for Nessa, said that in spite of a slew of reports on women's safety, little had been done by the government to protect them.""As we mourn the death of Sabina, it's clear that women are no safer on our streets today than they were in March; despite plenty of reports and consultations, the Government has made little progress on tackling violence against women and girls,"" she wrote in an op-ed for the Daily Mail.""The Government has promised more streetlights and CCTV -- but if violence against women and girls could be solved by a few more lampposts, the problem would have been solved long ago.""This story has been updated to correct the month when Sarah Everard went missing.

Garcia made his debut at the 1999 Ryder Cup, appearing at nine further tournaments. Read MoreIn 2006, he was unbeaten over the first two days, becoming only the second player after Ian Woosnam to win all four points from his foursomes and fourball matches.Entering this year's competition, Garcia had scored just as many points as the entire US team combined.During the previous Ryder Cup at Le Golf National, France, in 2018, Garcia overtook Nick Faldo's record to become Europe's all-time leading points scorer with 25.5 points.However, although he passed Faldo for the number of points, it took him until Saturday to pass him for the most matches won at the Ryder Cup. Faldo had 23 matches won, but now Garcia is the record holder, having earned his 23rd and 24th match victories in Wisconsin.

Support for the Independence Party, Iceland's biggest party, is also declining, but the election result may still give former Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson a mandate to form a new government.Read MoreA shattered political landscape will make it difficult to form a new government, but Jakobsdóttir may seek a coalition with other left-wing parties that opinion polls suggest will gain support.""If we get such a government, we are going to see some changes when it comes to taxation of the rich, and environmental questions are going to be more important,"" said Baldvin Bergsson, political analyst at broadcaster RUV.Climate change is an important issue for Icelanders, who like to call their nation the ""Land of Fire and Ice"" because of its other-worldly landscape of volcanoes and glaciers used in the HBO TV series ""Game of Thrones.""Iceland has already pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040, well ahead of most other European nations, but especially younger voters are pushing for even bolder steps.Left-wing parties are also calling for more government spending on healthcare, which has been the most important topic in the election.Shorter working week trials an 'overwhelming success' in IcelandSuccessful weathering of the pandemic and the lifting of coronavirus restrictions has reopened borders, providing a needed boost to the vital tourism sector, which attracted some 2 million foreign visitors in 2019.""The pandemic was a huge blow to the important tourism industry,"" said Stefania Oskarsdottir, a political scientist at University of Iceland, adding that high public spending has fueled optimism.""Despite coming out of a deep recession, the average Icelander feels that these are good times,"" she said.Polls open at 04:00 EST on Saturday and close at 17:00 EST with a final result expected on Sunday morning."

London's Metropolitan Police has arrested a 38-year old man on suspicion of the murder. In a statement on Thursday, the Met said the suspect had been arrested at an address in Lewisham. ""He was taken into custody where he remains,"" the statement read.Earlier in the day, the Met said Nessa had left her home in the borough of Greenwich just before 8:30 p.m. on September 17. Detectives believe that she was walking through Cator Park toward a bar in Pegler Square, where she had planned to meet a friend.Police are also searching for another man in connection with Nessa's murder, having released a picture of him and of a silver vehicle they believe he has access to.Read MoreNessa is thought to have been murdered on her journey through the park, the Met statement said, with her body found the following afternoon, close to a nearby community center.""Sabina's journey should have taken just over five minutes but she never made it to her destination,"" Detective Chief Inspector Joe Garrity said, adding: ""We know the community are rightly shocked by this murder -- as are we -- and we are using every resource available to us to find the individual responsible.""Garrity has appealed for anyone in the area of the park around the time of the attack to come forward. Zubel Ahmed, Nessa's cousin, told ITV News on Wednesday that the family is still in shock, and that the news of her death has left them ""devastated"" and ""inconsolable.""Nessa, who taught at a primary school in Lewisham, southeast London, was ""truly the most kind, caring person out there,"" Ahmed said. ""I don't understand how someone can do this, I really don't. It's a big, big loss to our family,"" he said. Epidemic of violence against womenNessa's death comes six months after the UK was left reeling following the assault and murder of 33-year-old Sarah Everard. Everard went missing after leaving a friend's house in Clapham, south London, on March 3. Her body was found a week later, more than 50 miles from where she was last seen. Her killer, a serving police officer, pleaded guilty to her kidnap, rape and murder. Everard's story prompted an outpouring across social media from women sharing their own experiences of sexual assault and harassment, catapulting the UK's damning record on violence against women and girls into the national spotlight. On the frontline with the British feminists trying to close the gap between rights and realityMore than 200 women were killed between March 2019 and 2020 in the UK, according to data from the Office for National Statistics and the Scottish government.One woman is killed by a man on average every three days in the UK, according to data from the Femicide Census, an organization that tracks violence against women and girls. The group argues that the government's new strategy to curb such violence ""shamefully ignores"" victims of femicide. Following Nessa's death, many are pointing out that little has changed. In a message posted to Twitter on Wednesday, Women's Equality Party leader Mandu Reid said: ""The media have been asking today: have things gotten better since Sarah Everard's murder? The answer is NO."" Reid added that the ""muted"" reaction from the press and a ""lack of public outcry"" for Nessa -- a woman of color -- ""demonstrates, once again, that not all victims are treated with the same respect and reverence.""In the wake of Everard's murder, the UK media's problematic relationship with diversity and race was again put under the spotlight. Many activists and social media users drew a comparison between the coverage of Everard's killing and the death of a 21-year-old Black business student, Blessing Olusegun, which garnered little national media attention. Olusegun's body was found on a beach on England's south coast in September 2020. Her ""unexplained"" death was not treated as suspicious by local police.JUST WATCHEDHow 'missing White woman syndrome' has real life implicationsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow 'missing White woman syndrome' has real life implications 02:56On Thursday, Greenwich Council told CNN that they had handed out 200 personal alarms to women and vulnerable residents in the borough this week ""following the horrific murder of Sabina Nessa.""The small device can be attached to keys and handbags or held, and activate a loud alarm in the event of an attack, a Greenwich Council spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the alarms have been distributed at events since 2019. But women shouldn't have to be on the defense. A report from a police watchdog in July said that ""radical,"" cross-sector reform is needed to protect women and girls from an ""epidemic"" of crime. Police should make the ""relentless"" pursuit and disruption of perpetrators a priority, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services said.From 2008-2018, 1,425 women were killed by men, according to Femicide Census data. The majority (62%) of those murders were committed by a woman's current or former partner, while 15% of women were killed by men that they knew. One in 12 (8%) of those murders were by strangers. Speaking on the Good Morning Britain program on Thursday morning, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said ""we have to give this issue the same seriousness we give other issues,"" adding that it was time to ""make misogyny a hate crime.""A vigil, organized by the group ""Reclaim These Streets"" will be held for Nessa on Friday at 7 p.m. at Pegler Square in Lewisham. This story has been updated to correct the month when Sarah Everard went missing. It was in March."

But after almost 16 years in the top job, she will step down once it becomes clear who her successor will be.The closeness of the race coupled with Germany's complicated voting system means it could take some time before a winning coalition is formed and the ultimate victor is known.Germany is the biggest economy in Europe.

This lead could mean a reversal of a 20-year-long downward trend for the Social Democrats. Over the past two decades, the party has lost around half of its voters.The Christian Democrats are trailing several percentage points behind the SPD at around 22.4%, polls indicate. This could mean a loss of 10.5 percentage points compared to the 2017 national elections, and of 19.1 percentage points compared to the 2013 elections.The Greens are currently polling at 15.9%, in third place. However, the ecological party could record the strongest growth of all parties in the next federal election, with a potential gain of 7.5 percentage points compared to the last national elections in 2017.

The AfD -- which saw a marked success in the 2017 elections following the influx of refugees into Germany in 2015 -- has struggled to keep its momentum going since and has faced harsh criticism over ties to the extreme far-right."

It's not the only climate crisis facing Germany's next chancellor,"Reinhardswald, Germany (CNN)Gazing out from the rocky ledge of Sleeping Beauty's castle in central Germany, the countryside below stretches out in a patchwork of light and dark green forests before stopping dead.  At the heart of this lush landscape sits a swath of dry, bare earth. The ground is empty, save for a few ghostly white trunks pointing skywards.  Viewed up close, this scene in the Reinhardswald nature park is equally desolate. Brittle sticks crunch underfoot and tree stumps dot the empty landscape, which stretches over some 50 acres.  The spruce trees that once stood here have been killed by a bark beetle infestation. The insects thrive in the warmer and drier weather conditions that occur more frequently because of climate change. ""Once the bark has peeled off, the trees look a bit like bones,"" said Peter Meyer, head of forest nature conservation at the North-West German Forest Research Institute in Göttingen and Hann Münden.  Read More



Bark beetle infestations are worsened by drought conditions, since once the tree has been weakened by a lack of water, it can't produce enough resin to combat the insects.  ""Then the beetle can just drill into the tree, lay eggs underneath the bark, and the larvae feed on the tree, interrupting the water supply, and that makes the tree die,"" Meyer explains. ""Drought is the trigger for bark beetle infestations.""  Germany has suffered historic drought in recent years and 2018 was the warmest since records began 140 years ago. In other parts of the country this summer, rain has fallen hard and fast, triggering deadly floods.All of these events have put the climate crisis squarely on the campaign trail ahead of Germany's federal election on Sunday. It's the first in 16 years that won't feature Chancellor Angela Merkel, and the candidates vying to replace her are all pitching their climate credentials.The crisis is being felt in many parts of Germany, and the country's fairy tale forests are no exception.  Sababurg Castle is said to have inspired the Grimm Brothers' fairy tale ""Sleeping Beauty.""Germany's climate election  Rose bushes cling to the ancient walls of the 14th century Sababurg Castle, said to have inspired the Grimm Brothers' fairy tale ""Sleeping Beauty.""On a chilly September morning, a steady stream of tourists is visiting. Their route here is lined with towering piles of logs -- all that remains of the Reinhardswald's damaged trees, cut down to halt the beetles' spread.The winding road is dotted, too, with electoral posters; the grinning faces of political candidates adorn lampposts and road signs, marking a national election in which green issues have taken center stage.  Germany's next chancellor will face a hefty list of climate challenges as they steer Europe's largest economy toward its goal of carbon neutrality by 2045, including the transition from fossil fuels to renewables; replacing combustion-engine cars with electric ones; and the completion of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which brings gas from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea.  Pamphlets are given out by the Social Democrats (SPD) at the main square in Alsfeld.The election comes just months after devastating floods in western Germany submerged entire towns and killed more than 180 people. At the other weather extreme, Germans suffered two years of extreme drought in 2018 and 2019 and watched as large parts of southern Europe were wrecked by wildfires this summer.  Scientists have warned for decades that climate change will make extreme weather events more frequent and intense, but this summer's floods created a fresh sense of urgency, prompting environment minister Svenja Schulze to declare that: ""Climate Change has arrived in Germany.""  All these events have led many to wonder how Germany will meet its emissions-reduction goals. The country has pledged a 65% cut in emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. There are also questions over whether Germany is doing its fair share to meet the Paris Agreement's target of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius.  Germany is off track in achieving its emission targets. It should be at 40% below 1990 levels this year, but an increase in emissions as it recovers from the pandemic means it will miss that target.It's a downbeat note for Merkel, once dubbed the ""Climate Chancellor,"" to leave office on. While she has supported ambitious emission-slashing goals, her government had only planned to phase out coal by 2038, regarded as late for a developed nation. And funding natural gas -- a climate-changing fossil fuel -- through Nord Stream 2 is a sore point.Merkel's replacement will play a leading role in shaping Europe's climate policy at a pivotal moment in the fight against global warming: In November, world leaders will gather in Glasgow, Scotland, for international climate talks, known as COP26. Germany's election will decide what life after Merkel looks like. Here's what you need to know""The approach that the next German government takes can have a major multiplier effect for European climate action, and EU climate leadership on the world stage,"" said Rafael Loss, co-ordinator for Pan-European Data Projects at the European Council on Foreign Relations.  But with just days to go before the election, it is not at all clear who will be the next chancellor. Polls put the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), led Olaf Scholz, slightly ahead of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), led by Armin Laschet.  Whatever the result on Sunday, lengthy coalition negotiations are expected -- and the Greens, led by Annalena Baerbock, are likely to be the kingmakers, polls show, meaning climate has become a key election issue in the country. A Greens presence in government would undoubtedly force Germany's next government to be more ambitious on climate.   Election campaign posters are seen in Holzhausen.A Grimm story  Baerbock's recent political advertisement was filmed in Germany's forests, a place of deep ecological and cultural importance to people here.   ""Your voice decides on the last government that can actively influence the climate crisis before it's too late,"" Baerbock says, as a drone camera zooms high above the Harz Mountains in northern Germany -- another region ravaged by the bark beetle.  Forests are among crucial solutions to the climate crisis: They suck up much of the world's carbon and store it safely underground. In Germany, they are the country's green lungs. Forests cover 11.4 million acres -- about a third of the country -- and capture roughly 62 million tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year, according to the Ministry of Food and Agriculture.  They are also a source of wealth, providing 76 million cubic meters of timber each year, for use in everything from construction to paper manufacturing. In the last seven years the average market value for Germany's roundwood production amounted to over 3.5 billion euros ($4.1 billion) annually.  But Germany's forests are, by some measures, in their worst shape for decades.  More trees died in 2020 than in any other year on record, according to the government's annual Forest Conditions Report. The study examined 10,000 trees across the country and found that just 21% had an intact canopy -- an indication of how healthy a tree is -- the lowest percentage since studies began 37 years ago.  ""Crown condition is like a medical thermometer; it shows how the trees are doing. The survey shows: our forests are sick,"" said Agriculture Minister Julia Kloeckner. The main culprits were the bark beetles. The insects mainly attack spruces, which are the most common tree species in Germany, making up 25% of the country's forests.  Last year, around 43.3 million cubic meters of damaged timber had to be cut down as a result of bark beetle infestation, according to the Federal Office of Statistics. Germany's spruce forests date back to the reforestation efforts of the 19th and 20th century, when degraded woodlands were restocked with this fast-growing tree species. Broadleaved forests were also converted to spruce forests.Peter Meyer shows an area where trees were completely destroyed by the bark beetle.Meyer estimates that this decimated patch of spruce trees in Reinhardswald Nature Park, within hiking distance of Sleeping Beauty's castle, is around 80 years old.  To the average passer-by, the brittle landscape looks like a graveyard of skeletal tree trunks. But Meyer, who has studied trees for more than three decades, sees signs of scraggly new growth; he says if left to its own devices, the forest can heal.  A short distance from the Sleeping Beauty castle also sits the lush Sababurg Primeval Forest.   Step amid the trees here and the temperature drops away as the sunlight disappears behind a thick canopy of leaves. Towering oaks -- some dating back 600 years -- stretch their gnarled limbs, cloaked in a shiny jacket of green moss towards the sky. Unlike the decimated spruce forest nearby, this woodland has been spared the devastation caused by bark beetle infestation.  Experts hope forests like this one can offer clues as to which tree species may be more resistant to rising temperatures in future. So far, they have found that ""oak trees appear to be more tolerant to drought and water logging, to extremes of climate, than beech trees for example,"" Meyer says.  Meyer holds up a picture taken about 100 years ago of the oak tree behind him.A 21st century enchanted woodForests aren't just Germany's lungs -- they are part of its cultural heart.  The country's woods are the centuries-old backdrop to fairy tales like ""Red Riding Hood,"" ""Snow White"" and ""Hansel and Gretel;"" the ideal, spooky setting for encounters with mythical creatures.  The stories were collected by the Brothers Grimm in the 19th century. They have since been translated into more than 160 languages and are still read to children across the world.  The brothers' childhood home at Steinau, in central Germany's Hesse region, has been transformed into a museum.   On a sunny Saturday afternoon, tourists wander around the imposing building where the family lived in the 1790s. Small children squeal with delight as a storyteller dressed as a goat tap-tap-taps on a small wooden door in the pretty gardens; nearby, seven-stone dwarves stand guard by the rose bushes. A storyteller dressed as a goat leads a tour of the Brothers Grimm House.Forests feature in at least a third of the roughly 250 stories collected by the brothers, according to the museum's curator Burkhard Kling.   One room inside the museum is dedicated entirely to forests, with dozens of tiny dioramas featuring familiar characters in woodland settings, confronting wolves or nibbling candy houses.  Kling explains why woods inspire such fear and wonder among storytellers: ""It's dark. You don't know what is behind the next tree... You don't know if there's an animal that wants to catch you,"" but: ""When you see the light behind the trees, you can find hope.""  Germany's fairy-tale townsThe effects of climate change are also being felt at other stops along Germany's popular fairy tale tourist trail.  Alsfeld is known as ""Red Riding Hood town,"" after the traditional red caps worn by girls in the region. 





This picturesque spot markets itself as a must-see for fairy tale enthusiasts, attracting some 90,000 overnight visitors each year. Its 14th century bookshop is lined with copies of ""Red Riding Hood"" books in multiple languages. Nearby, a crooked half-timbered building nearby has been transformed into a house of fairy tales, complete with Rapunzel's long plait trailing from the third-story window. The gardens of the local church often play host to open-air performances of the Grimm Brothers' stories.  When not playing the grandmother in one of these ""Red Riding Hood"" performances, Jenny Wagner works as a tour guide, thrilling visitors with tales set in the deep, dark woods. But over the last three decades she's seen the nearby forests of her childhood change dramatically.  ""When I was a young girl, we often went on hiking trips into the forest and there was a bed of leaves above you,"" says Wagner. ""You can hardly find that anymore. If you go into the forest, you have a lot of trees that don't really carry any leaves.""  The forests around Alsfeld are a big draw for visitors; Mayor Stephan Paule says without these recreational spaces the town -- and its economy -- would suffer; an important ""source of revenue for the town will disappear,"" he warns.Characters perform ""Little Red Riding Hood"" at the monestary garden.Age-old tale  The challenges facing Germany's forests have changed a lot in the last four decades. So too have its environmental activists.  Meyer, a softly-spoken scientist with a knack for spotting tiny apples or mushrooms hidden amid the foliage, began studying forestry in the 1980s, at a time when acid rain was killing Germany's woods -- a phenomenon known as ""Waldsterben,"" or forest dieback.  ""It was sort of a catastrophic impression of the forests, and that we really have to act to do something,"" he said.  Efforts were made to clean up the coal mines and the forests revived. But the environmental calamity left its mark on Germans, who saw the woods as part of their identity.  The ""Waldsterben"" of the 1980s, along with concerns over nuclear power, became central to the budding Green Party's activism.  Kristina Kuethe, Peter Meyer's partner, stands in a rejuvenated forest.Decades on, Germany's new generation of environmental activists take a broader view of the climate crisis.  ""The emotional connection my parents' generation, my grandparents' generation, has to forest is very different to my connection,"" explains Helena Marschall, a 19-year-old economics and politics student at Leuphana University, who is part of the Fridays for the Future school strikes against global warming.  Marschall says that while she is concerned about the state of German forests, ""the climate crisis is fundamentally a question of my life, and not so much an abstract concept of nature.""  Merkel is the only chancellor Marshall has ever known -- this will be the first national election in which she is old enough to cast her vote. She says the so-called ""Climate Chancellor"" hasn't lived up to her billing, and sees this election as a chance to ""build a different kind of politics.""  Just days before Germans go to the polls, the Fridays for the Future movement plans mass demonstrations across the country, with millions expected to take part.  Germany's fairy-tale forests have survived for hundreds of years -- the challenge for the next chancellor will be to ensure they are protected far into the future."

The pair arrived in Russia this weekend separated by just five points, with Verstappen maintaining a slender lead over the seven-time World Championship winner following their dramatic collision in Italy last time out.Upon landing in Sochi, Hamilton was asked if he believed Verstappen was feeling the heat of their title rivalry, which had simmered long before the crash at Monza.""Obviously, he won't admit it and I'm not going to make an assumption,"" Hamilton replied. ""But I'm just saying I remember what it was like when I had my first one and it definitely mounted up.""""It was difficult, it was intense, I was going through a lot of different emotions, I didn't always handle it the best and that's to be expected. There's a lot of pressure, you're working in a big team, there's a lot of self-expectation and pressure because the desire to win is huge,"" Hamilton added.The Englishman's answer was relayed to Verstappen, who proceeded to answer with more than a hint of sarcasm.""Yeah, I'm so nervous, I can hardly sleep. It's so horrible to fight for a title. I really hate it,"" Verstappen said.""No, I think if someone really knows me, I'm very relaxed about all those things and I really can't be bothered, you know, I'm very chilled. It's the best feeling ever to have a car, a great car where you go into every weekend and you can fight for a win,"" he continued.""It doesn't matter if you're just leading a championship or not, those comments just shows you that he doesn't really know me, which is fine, I don't need to know him, how he is fully. ""I just focus on myself and I really enjoy it out there at the front and, of course, hopefully we can do it for a really long time.""Verstappen and Hamilton collide at the Italian Grand Prix, Monza.Collision courseTensions have been bubbling between the two title chasers all season, with hostilities extending to the respective team principals at Red Bull and Mercedes.Following a collision on lap one between the drivers at the British Grand Prix in July, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said Hamilton had been ""completely out of order,"" with his Mercedes counterpart Toto Wolff responding that Red Bull's comments on Hamilton were ""below the belt."" With Verstappen retired from the race, the fact that Hamilton went on to take victory at Silverstone only intensified the rivalry -- Verstappen tweeting his disappointment at Hamilton's ""disrespectful and unsportsmanlike"" celebrations. The dramatic crash at Monza earlier this month rocketed tensions to new heights, figuratively and literally, as Verstappen's car landed on top of Hamilton's following a wheel-to-wheel engagement. Hamilton, who said after the race he felt ""fortunate to be alive,"" told his team via the radio that the Red Bull driver had forced him wide, while Verstappen could be heard saying ""that's what you get when you don't leave the space."""

Sign up here.London (CNN)It's been a gloriously sunny week here in London and we had the pleasure of heading to Buckingham Palace to find out how plans to mark the Queen's 70 years on the throne are coming along. As you might expect, organizers are pulling out all the stops for the celebrations to honor the sovereign's seven decades of service in 2022.While the Queen technically ascended the throne on February 6, 1952, the first major event next year will actually take place in May and is set to celebrate one of her greatest passions -- her love of horses.A four-day equestrian extravaganza will be held in the private grounds of Windsor Castle from May 12. Viewed by organizers as a warm-up act to the main holiday weekend in June, 500 horses -- including some of the Queen's own ponies -- as well as 1,000 dancers, musicians and members of the armed forces will perform in a 90-minute show for an audience of over 4,000 members of the public each night (Covid measures permitting). Tickets for the production went on sale on Wednesday, with proceeds going to various charities. A company of actors known as the Queen's Players will lead the theatrical spectacle, envisioned as a ""gallop through history,"" from the reign of Elizabeth I to the current second Elizabethan era. ""There is a really good bookending there between two of our great female monarchs,"" said Simon Brooks-Ward, the show's producer and director, at a special launch event at the Royal Mews, a working stables at Buckingham Palace.  He explained that the performance also takes in the ""colorful characters that populated our past, celebrates our achievements through our people and what we've done in the past."" He added: ""After two years that we've had it's going to be lighthearted (and) joyful, but actually also traditional and respectful.""Read MoreIt will also feature visiting performers from Oman, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, France, Norway, Switzerland, Canada, the Caribbean and India.

For example, there was the time when a Polynesian band was left without instruments to rehearse with, after customs confiscated them because the group had stuffed fruit ""down the trombones and other things.""Then there was the time a vaulting athlete landed with a ""splat,"" sparking concern among the audience (don't worry -- he was checked by medical crews, who determined he was just winded). Or the ""biblical deluge"" in 2002 that threatened to overflow a canopy over the Royal Box, under which the Earl and Countess of Wessex were seated. In that instance, some quick-thinking staff brought ""what can only be described as the poo and pee sucker from the outside"" bathrooms, which helped pump away the rainwater and avoid a complete disaster. ""We've had some fun over the years,"" Brooks-Ward said.The final night of the event will also be broadcast live by British TV station ITV. Then in June, there will be a four-day holiday weekend with a program of events including a parade, street parties and a concert at Buckingham Palace.Mike Rake, the chairman of the Platinum Jubilee's advisory committee, told CNN that the celebrations in May will showcase the ""enormous respect that the Queen has for hundreds of million people in the Commonwealth around the world and how she's really held the Commonwealth together in many ways, and how she stands at a very febrile time politically for the United Kingdom.""He added: ""The Queen stands as sort of a beacon of something that speaks to a United Kingdom, that speaks of service, that speaks of integrity. And I think that stands well with people in a very difficult time for the country and for the world.""DID YOU KNOW?The Duke and Duchess of Sussex visit One World Observatory in New York City on September 23, 2021.

They will be popping up on the Great Lawn in New York City's Central Park on Saturday during the Global Citizen Live concert. The pair will be once again stressing the importance of vaccine equity around the world, having previously celebrated their son, Archie's, birthday with a fundraising campaign and co-chaired the VAX LIVE concert in May.

What's next?The Duke of York was served with legal papers in the civil sexual assault suit brought by Virginia Roberts Giuffre this week. US court documents seen by CNN show the papers were sent to his lawyer, Andrew B. Brettler, in Los Angeles on Monday. His legal team have repeatedly denied the claims, and called the suit ""baseless, non-viable (and) potentially unlawful."" Guiffre alleges that she was assaulted in London, New York and the US Virgin Islands by the royal, and that Andrew was aware she was 17 at the time and had been trafficked by the late sex offender Jeffery Epstein. The duke's legal team now have 21 days to respond if they intend to engage with the suit. If they do, they can choose to submit an answer or apply for a motion to dismiss. If they do not engage with the case and submit to the jurisdiction of a US court, it would be up to a judge to determine if the case could proceed. And if it did continue, questions would be raised over the enforcement of any verdict without Andrew's cooperation. Despite the immediate uncertainty ahead, it's a step forward for Giuffre. Her lawyer, David Boies, told CNN on Tuesday that they were ""pleased"" the service issue had been resolved so that ""we can proceed to a resolution of Ms. Giuffre's claims.""

Although Spanish pairing Jon Rahm and Sergio Garcia provided some European resistance, it was the red of the US which painted the leaderboard. Rookies Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele dominated the experienced Rory McIlroy and Ian Poulter to win 5&3, Brooks Koepka and Daniel Berger edged Lee Westwood and Matt Fitzpatrick, while Dustin Johnson and Collin Morikawa beat Paul Casey and Viktor Hovland.And in the afternoon, it wasn't much better for the visitors.

The battle between Bryson DeChambeau and Scottie Scheffler and Rahm Tyrrell Hatton was fiercely contested, with a key putt from Hatton on the last hole winning the European team a vital half point.And in the final foursome of the day, it was another hotly-fought battle, with European pairing of Tommy Fleetwood and Hovland surrendering a lead to Thomas and Cantlay, with the match also ending in a tie, leaving the American's with a four-point advantage after day one.  Tony Finau celebrates after winning his afternoon Fourball matches on Friday.Trusting the conditionsThe morning of the Ryder Cup was wrought with excitement. Fans packed the stands by the first tee even before the sun had risen, singing songs about their beloved Team US. And when the players teed off, all was calm, and players took advantage. Scoring was low and the contests were tight. But eventually, the home team -- with a team full of major winners -- was able to turn the screw. Although Rahm and Garcia were in control in the opening foursomes match, it was much more tense in the following two games.A late flurry of birdies helped Johnson and Morikawa to victory, and while Westwood and Fitzpatrick were able to hold off the US' birdies, they couldn't bite back at Koepka and Berger, eventually losing 2&1. And the final foursome was a complete domination from start to finish, as Cantlay and Schauffele birdied the opening five holes to take a commanding lead, birdieing the final two to clinch a commanding victory. While conditions were calm in the opening round of foursomes, the wind off of Lake Michigan picked up before the afternoon's fourballs, making conditions tricky for players. But immediately in the opening fourballs -- between Johnson and Schauffele of the US and Wiesberger and Casey of Europe -- the home team mastered the conditions from the start. The pair picked up four birdies in the opening five holes, opening up a big lead.

The 32-year-old carded four birdies and no bogeys as he dominated with English to win 4&3. The final fourball of the day came right down to the wire.

She had just helped Sweden beat Canada in the round of 16 when she spotted partner and Danish international Harder, also wearing a Swedish jersey, in the stands of the Parc des Princes stadium.Eriksson approached her and the two shared a celebratory kiss.

The 58-year-old was left incensed in the dying seconds of the match after arguing with the referee and match officials. Earlier in the game, Koeman was furious when midfielder Frenkie de Jong was shown a red card and tempers continued to flair until he was dismissed in the final stages. It comes amid criticism of Barça's form this season, with Koeman's young side failing to gel after the departure of Lionel Messi. The Catalan giants have won just twice in their first five league games, sit seventh in La Liga and were thrashed 3-0 by Bayern Munich in the Champions League.

Attention has since been switched to bringing young talent into the first-team but such inexperience on the pitch has become a problem in recent weeks. Koeman also lamented his side's injury problems which prevented a number of senior players from playing against lowly Cádiz.

Here's how 4 countries are dealing with them,"(CNN)Most European countries have Covid-19 vaccination rates that would be the envy of much of the world. But even here, hesitancy in certain areas is causing governments to take action -- or risk stalling their efforts to control the spread of the virus.The highly transmissible Delta variant and concerns that winter in the northern hemisphere could bring a bad flu season have increased the urgency for authorities to boost vaccine uptake.Reasons for hesitancy are varied. Some people believe they are fit, healthy and young, so getting vaccinated is not a priority. Some found it too complicated to book a vaccine so gave up. And some simply distrust their government to the extent that they've become susceptible to misinformation.So what are different governments doing to encourage those who have not been vaccinated, for whatever reason, to get the shot?Belgium: Unvaccinated urged to 'examine their conscience'  Read MoreWhile 72% of Belgium's population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19, rates vary widely across the country of about 11.5 million people.In the capital, Brussels, only 51% of the total population is fully vaccinated, according to the latest data from the country's health authority, Sciensano. That compares with 79% for its Dutch-speaking Flanders region and 67% for French-speaking Wallonia.Authorities are now increasing pressure on vaccine holdouts in the capital in the hope of boosting vaccination rates.How Europe's hospitals are faring in the face of another pandemic fallWhile restrictions such as the mandatory wearing of face masks indoors have been eased elsewhere in the country, they remain in place for Brussels because of its lower vaccination rate and the strain that Covid-19 cases are placing on the city's hospitals.And from October 1, the regional government in Brussels will also require residents to show a ""Covid pass"" to prove that they have been vaccinated or have recently tested negative for the virus before they can enter restaurants, bars or fitness clubs, according to Reuters.This may go some way to encourage reluctant younger residents to get the shot. According to official figures, only 46% of those aged 18 to 24 in Brussels have received at least one vaccine dose, compared with 86% for the same age group in Flanders and 72% in Wallonia. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo had harsh words for the nation last Friday.""Those who do not get vaccinated are responsible for the fact that stricter rules remain necessary in some places,"" he said. ""Intensive care is rapidly becoming a gathering place for the unvaccinated. We cannot accept that as a society. No one has the right to voluntarily put other people at risk.""Nurses at major hospitals in Brussels wrote an open letter last week saying they were ""tired and angry"" at the continuing Covid-19 crisis and pleading with everyone to get vaccinated. Kenneth Coenye, chief medical officer at the Sint-Jan Clinic in Brussels, told CNN that during the last weekend of August, only four out of 70 patients being treated in Covid ICUs in the city were vaccinated. ""It's very painful, of course, because they don't only get sick, they die. And that is so completely preventable,"" he said.Speaking Saturday, the leader of Wallonia -- Belgium's largest region -- urged citizens who have not yet received their Covid-19 vaccination ""to understand the consequences of their inaction and procrastination.""""We are not done with this damned virus because vaccination coverage remains insufficient,"" Minister-President Elio Di Rupo said. ""The unvaccinated bear a heavy responsibility for themselves, and those close to them. The time has therefore come for everyone to examine their conscience.""France: Health pass boosts vaccine uptakeMeasures proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron this summer have had a marked impact on vaccine hesitancy.Late last year, polls showed barely 40% of the French expressed any intention of becoming vaccinated. But as of September 15, nearly 64% of the population was fully vaccinated and more than 73% had had at least one dose, according to figures from Our World in Data.Under legislation announced by Macron on July 12, people in France have since August been required to carry a Covid health pass, or ""pass sanitaire,"" to enter premises including bars, restaurants, cinemas and theaters, and many outdoor public spaces.The pass -- which shows proof of either vaccination, a negative Covid-19 test or of past infection -- is also required for travel on long-distance public transport and to visit medical facilities.A Covid pass takes France by stormFrom September 30, children aged 12 and above will also have to comply with health pass rules. Workers in sites under the health pass mandate have themselves needed to be inoculated since August 30, and from October 15 this will also apply to health workers.Macron's July 12 announcement prompted tens of thousands of protesters to take to the streets, calling for the government to scrap the new rules. However, it was also followed by an immediate spike in demand for vaccine appointments. French government spokesman Gabriel Attal hailed what he called a ""French success"" on Wednesday. ""We surpassed at the end of last week the threshold of 50 million vaccinated individuals and this number continues to rise,"" he said, adding that 14 million individuals had been incentivized to be vaccinated since July 12.But despite this, Attal warned that vigilance was still needed.Some areas, particularly in the south and east of the country, still have relatively lower Covid-19 vaccination rates, including the northern half of Corsica, where 59.7% of the population has received at least one dose, according to Ameli, France's national health insurance body. The next lowest ranking are Seine-Saint-Denis, outside Paris, at 59.8%, Alpes de Haute Provence at 64.7% and Bouches-du-Rhône, home to the city of Marseille, where 64.9% of the population have received at least one dose.Demonstrators march in Marseille, southern France, during a national day of protest against the health pass mandated by the government in August.Meanwhile, figures for France's overseas territories are significantly lower than for the mainland.""In several territories -- notably Guyana, French Polynesia, and New Caledonia -- the situation remains extremely concerning and requires both the continuation of preventative measures and reinforcements,"" Attal said. Only 18.4% of the population in Guyana has received at least one vaccine dose, according to figures from Ameli.Some 587,000 people in France have already received a Covid-19 booster shot, Attal added. ""I implore the French citizens who have not been vaccinated to do so, just as I implore our elderly to resort to the booster option,"" he said.Italy: All workers will have to show a health passItaly's government extended its mandatory health pass to all workers on September 16 in a bid to improve vaccine coverage. The measure is due to come into force on October 15.The country had already required all health workers to be vaccinated. And, since August 6, a ""certificazione verde,"" or green pass, has been needed to enter cultural sites such as museums or galleries, entertainment and sports venues, theme parks, spas, and to eat indoors. This was extended to include domestic flights, train travel between regions, as well as sea travel on September 1.The latest measure was introduced to ""make the vaccination campaign even stronger,"" said Health Minister Roberto Speranza.Italy to mandate Covid-19 'Green Pass' for all workersJust two days later, on September 18, the government commissioner in charge of the vaccination campaign recorded a countrywide increase in bookings of first Covid-19 vaccine doses of between 20% and 40%, compared to the previous week.According to government figures, over 76% of the population aged 12 and over is fully vaccinated, while around 82% has received at least one shot.But take-up still lags in some parts of Italy.According to the Gimbe Foundation, based on the data provided by the Health Ministry and the National Institute of Statistics, the areas with the lowest Covid-19 vaccination rates are the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, in the South Tyrol Alps, and the regions of Calabria and Sicily, in the far south of the country.In Bolzano, 61.3% of the total population has had two doses, while the figure stands at 63.7% for Calabria and 62.7% for Sicily.People wait in a vaccination center on August 7 in Bari, southern Italy. Thomas Widmann, who heads the Bolzano health department, told CNN in a written message that a variety of factors contributed to South Tyrol's lower vaccination rate.""The hypotheses range from a greater propensity to homemade remedies, like medicinal herbs used in peasant tradition; there are those who assume a more marked anti-authoritarian tendency than elsewhere, for historical reasons; but I think more practical hypotheses should also be considered, such as logistical difficulties,"" he said.""For those who live at the bottom of a mountain valley, going to a city vaccination center can mean wasting a lot of time.""A vaccine bus service was launched in July to reach the more remote areas of South Tyrol.Meanwhile, Sicily's regional president, Nello Musomeci, has made frequent appeals for its population to get vaccinated, describing it as a ""civic duty"" in a message to the island's mayors last month. ""How unfair it would be to make everyone pay the hard price of those who do not want to get vaccinated!"" he said.Despite such exhortations, the announcement of the mandatory health pass for all workers led to an increase of only 5% in the number of people aged 20 and 59 booking vaccinations in Sicily in the week September 15-21.Germany: No more compensation for unvaccinated workers who lose payVaccinations in Germany are not compulsory. But authorities have been stepping up measures that make life increasingly inconvenient for people who remain unvaccinated against Covid-19.On Wednesday, the German Health Ministry announced new rules that mean unvaccinated workers will no longer receive compensation for lost pay if coronavirus measures forced them into quarantine.The new rules will come into force from November 1 and will affect people who test positive for Covid-19 and those returning from countries designated as ""high risk"" Covid-19 areas, Health Minister Jens Spahn told reporters.Germans shocked by killing of cashier after Covid mask argumentThese countries currently include the United Kingdom, Turkey and parts of France, according to Germany's public health agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Unvaccinated travelers from these ""high risk"" areas are required to quarantine for at least five days. Those who are fully vaccinated or have recently recovered from Covid-19 are not. Spahn defended the new rules, asking: ""Why should others pay for the fact that someone has decided not to be vaccinated?"" He stressed, however, that the new rules were a matter of fairness to everyone. ""Some people will say this means pressure for the unvaccinated. I think we have to look at it the other way around -- it is also a question of fairness,"" he said.The German trade union confederation (DGB) criticized the move, saying it dumped responsibility for the fight against the pandemic onto employees. ""We still reject mandatory vaccination through the back door,"" DGB chairman Reiner Hoffmann told Editor Network Germany.Germany's Health Ministry had previously announced that Covid-19 tests, which the unvaccinated must undertake to be allowed to dine inside restaurants, for example, will stop being free of charge from October 11.A total of 63.6% of the German population had been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 as of Thursday, according to the RKI -- under the 85% threshold deemed necessary by the RKI for herd immunity.CNN's Joseph Ataman contributed to this report."

""I think there's more heckling now, although I've not been at the Ryder Cup the past few years. I've only seen it, which is different. At Kiawah it got too much.

Here's what you need to know,"(CNN)Germans will file into polling stations to vote in an unpredictable federal election on Sunday -- but for the first time in nearly two decades, their longtime leader won't be in contention.Chancellor Angela Merkel has been a symbol of stability in Europe since she took on the role in 2005; the chemist-turned-political mainstay has withstood a wave of populism, a financial crisis, a pandemic and Brexit to carve out an impressive legacy as the world's most successful female leader.But Merkel, 67, will step down once the repercussions of Sunday's vote become clear, a move that has cast a sense of uncertainty over the weekend's election.Compared to the previous votes in 2017 and 2013, there is ""much more chance of a significant shift in German politics and policy after the election,"" according to Pepijn Bergsen, a research fellow who monitors the country for international think tank Chatham House.The race to become Merkel's successor is tight, and the ultimate victor may not be known for days or even weeks after polls close. Read MoreBut for the first time in a generation, Germans will be deciding what post-Merkel Germany will look like. Whoever they turn to will face a catalog of challenges, both at home and abroad.Merkel has provided a steady hand domestically and abroad, but Germans must now decide on her successor.Where is Merkel?Merkel's departure from the front lines of global politics has been a long time coming; she first announced in 2018 that she would not seek re-election at the end of her term, following a series of setbacks in regional elections.In her time in office, she has dealt with five UK prime ministers, four French presidents, seven Italian prime ministers, and four American commanders-in-chief. Her period in power has been a remarkably eventful one, and Merkel's imperturbable presence throughout has earned her an international reputation for stability and level-headedness. ""That worked very well politically for her in Germany, and on the world stage,"" Bergsen told CNN. ""Germany has done very well over the last 15 years from an economic perspective ... (and) Germany didn't do that badly during the financial crisis, but the realization has crept in that that won't last.""The European refugee crisis of the mid-2010s proved a major challenge to Merkel's party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and she has also earned detractors over her close relationship with China. But after a pandemic which saw Germany fare better than many of its neighbors, analysts and polling suggest Merkel will leave office with the respect of most Germans. ""She's seen very positively in Germany, because she's associated with stability -- people know what they're getting,"" said Ben Schreer, from the International Institute for Strategic Studies' (IISS) Berlin-based Europe office.Who's in the race to replace her?German politics is dominated by two parties -- the center-right CDU and the left-leaning Social Democratic Party, or SPD -- who have governed together in a coalition for the past eight years. But other parties have grown in popularity over the past decade as the CDU and SPD have lost ground. This election is particularly close; the CDU and SPD have both held polling advantages, and the Green Party has also emerged as a serious contender.Merkel's successor at the helm of the CDU is Armin Laschet, 60, a long-time ally of the Chancellor and the party's deputy leader since 2012. A devout Catholic whose father was at one point a coal mining engineer, he was selected as the party's candidate after a torturous leadership tussle.Laschet has a background in law and journalism, and was elected to the German Bundestag in 1994.Laschet won a protracted leadership campaign to replace Merkel, but he is struggling to attract voters on the national stage.Merkel has voiced her support for Laschet, but despite her efforts to persuade Germans to stick with the CDU, polling suggests her replacement as the party's leader has struggled to win over Germans.His foremost opponent is the SPD's Olaf Scholz, who has taken a surprise lead in the polls in recent weeks, leaving him as the marginal frontrunner heading into Sunday's vote. Like Laschet, Scholz has a long history as a political player in Germany. He has been Merkel's finance minister and vice chancellor since 2018, placing him arguably in a better position to run as her natural successor than her own party's candidate.Scholz has earned increased visibility as he navigated Germany's economic response to the pandemic, and cleared the last electoral hurdle with an assured performance in the final television debate. But polls nonetheless suggest a huge number of undecided voters late in the campaign, increasing the unpredictability of the vote.The Green Party's leader Annalena Baerbock caused a brief sensation in German politics when she surged in the polls early in the campaign, prompting voters to wonder whether she could become the country's first ever Green chancellor.Olaf Scholz has taken a surprise lead in polling in recent weeks.A 40-year-old former professional trampolinist, Baerbock stands out in a field of mostly male political leaders. And although her star has faded somewhat in the closing stretch, she has capitalized on voters' climate concerns to establish her group as the third party in the race. The far-right AfD remains a stubborn presence on the political scene, scrapping with the liberal Free Democratic Party for fourth place. The refugee crisis that sparked the AfD's surge in German politics has subsided as a pressing political issue, but the party remains an outlet for voters angered by immigration issues. In March, they became the first German party since the Nazi era to be put under government surveillance. How does the voting work?German elections to the Bundestag are run on a system of proportional representation, meaning that each party's vote share relates directly to how many seats they get in parliament. That principle makes it virtually impossible for a party to lead a government alone; coalitions must instead be formed after the vote, and these often contain more than two groups.Many Germans have already cast their ballots; the pandemic has increased the amount of postal voting that took place before polling day. Regardless of how they choose to vote, Germans are asked to pick their local lawmaker, and also their preferred overall party. Once the results come in, a race will start to put together enough seats to govern -- meaning smaller parties can become kingmakers.""Whoever wins on paper on Sunday night probably can't be sure that he or she will actually lead the government, because there's going to be so many permutations,"" Schreer explained, adding: ""We may not know until November, if we're lucky.""What are the issues?All the candidates are caught in a Merkel-sized conundrum, as they attempt to define their own agendas while allaying Germans' fears over a change in leadership. Climate change has been a major factor in the country's national debate, particularly after devastating flooding hit the country in July. In Canada and Germany, the climate crisis is finally on the ballot. But can it win?A push from Merkel has put environmental issues at the heart of German politics, and virtually all parties have stressed their green credentials. In this campaign the Green Party has called for a 70% cut in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2030, compared to the current government goal of a 55% cut.Economic worries have also come to the fore; in a last-gasp pitch to voters, Laschet said Monday that a left-wing coalition led by the SPD would cause a ""severe economic crisis,"" Reuters reported. Laschet has also followed Merkel's line regarding the European Union; in the final pre-election debate, he emphasized European cohesion as one of his flagship policies.  But the campaign has been mostly defined by domestic matters; a minimum wage hike and pension reforms are at the heart of Scholz's campaign, and he stressed those plans again in the debate.Will a Merkel-less Germany still lead on the world stage?The global consequences of Sunday's vote are clear; Merkel's longevity saw her become Europe's de facto leader, and it's unclear whether her successor will fill the same role.""Germany's going to be faced with some significant foreign policy challenges which the new government has to take on,"" Schreer said. ""The question is, who's going to replace (Merkel), and will that person have the same charisma and ability that she did?"" he added. ""Allies are skeptical, and Germans as well are quite cautious in that regard.""A key part of Merkel's role was her steadfast determination to maintain European cohesion and paper over the cracks between EU member states. Merkel has outlasted dozens of major leaders during her 16-year period in power.""Macron will try to usurp Merkel's position in Europe,"" predicted Bergsen, signaling a possible shift in the balance of power towards France, Germany's western neighbor. ""The German position won't necessarily change, but whoever now comes to power will have to deal with a broader (domestic) coalition so they will find it slightly harder to lead on the international stage.""Looking further afield, Germany's new leader will also have to balance the country's relationships with the United States and China, two nations with whom Merkel attempted to maintain close ties.And keeping the United Kingdom close after its departure from the EU is key. ""The UK remains an important partner in strategic terms, and Germany knows that if the UK isn't engaged in the European continent, then you will split the Europeans,"" said Schreer.""(Germany) is a well-respected country at the international stage -- that is undoubtedly the case,"" he added. ""The question is: Does that now enable Germany to weather those international storms that are certainly coming?"""

Now they wonder who'll fill the void,"(CNN)Angela Merkel has been written off many times in her career -- by the politician's rivals, her own party members and, yes, the press.   It's difficult to imagine today, as Germany's widely respected Chancellor prepares to step down after more than 15 years in the top job, but in the early stages of her career Merkel was regularly belittled and looked down on -- even by those who were supposedly on her side.  The protégé of then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Merkel was known by him as ""mein Maedel"" -- ""my girl.""  ""She always was underestimated by her enemies and by other politicians, and when they realized that a woman from the east is able to play this power game, it was too late,"" Ralph Bollmann, author of the authoritative Merkel biography ""Angela Merkel: The Chancellor and Her Time,"" told CNN.The media only added to this sense that Merkel was not a serious political contender.  Read MoreAt one of her earliest media appearances as the new leader of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Berlin in 2001, Merkel appeared out of her depth.  Uneasy in front of the bright lights and cameras of the press pack, she seemed not to know where to look or what to do with her hands, and gave flat, boring answers to reporters' questions. Chatting afterwards, many of the (mostly male) journalists present agreed: This woman would never be chancellor.   Germany's election will decide what life after Merkel looks like. Here's what you need to knowBut what did they know? Merkel went on to secure four terms in office, making her one of the longest-serving chancellors in German history -- only Kohl, the mentor she eventually turned her back on, has served longer in the modern era.   Two decades on, she has cemented her position as an elder stateswoman, having led her nation -- indeed some would argue Europe as a whole -- through a series of potentially devastating crises.Named the most powerful woman in the world several times over, Merkel also played a crucial role on the international stage, helping to manage the global financial crisis, the refugee crisis, and the war in Ukraine.  As Germany prepares to go to the polls this weekend to elect a new government, and by extension her successor, it is not clear whether any of those lining up to replace her -- Armin Laschet of Merkel's own CDU, the center-left Socialist Party (SPD)'s Olaf Scholz, or the Greens' Annalena Baerbock -- will be able to fill her shoes.  Bollmann says the world will sorely miss Merkel's steady leadership: ""I think there is one common thing in Germany and abroad: She is seen as a guarantor of stability. In future times many people will look back at this time as a time -- perhaps the last time -- of stability.""   Angela Merkel was sworn in as Germany's first female chancellor in November 2005.  'Don't fool yourself' Merkel, 67, grew up under Communism in East Germany, and trained as a scientist, earning a doctorate in quantum chemistry before making a move into politics following the fall of the Berlin Wall. She won a seat in the Bundestag, Germany's parliament, in the first election after reunification.   In the years that followed, Merkel would not only become the first female Chancellor of Germany but would also change the country's politics for good.  Yet when the CDU won Germany's elections in 2005 -- by just 1% -- it was widely seen as having happened despite Merkel's perceived weaknesses, not because of her.   Appearing on TV talk show ""The Elephant Round,"" after the nail-bitingly close 2005 vote, the incumbent Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder appeared dismissive of Merkel, laughing off the notion that she would be able to form a governing coalition.   ""She will not manage to form a coalition with my Social Democratic Party,"" he said. ""Don't fool yourself.""Merkel held her tongue, but went on to do just that, patiently biding her time before working to form a so-called ""grand coalition"" between the two largest parties -- the CDU and the SPD -- and, in doing so, ending Schroeder's political career. The imperturbable, unemotional Merkel had triumphed.  Merkel greets visitors as she walks to the Chapel of Reconciliation before attending a memorial service to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, on November 9, 2019. ""There are many things she learnt from her youth ... in the GDR, in Communism, because she had to hide her real opinions, not saying something ... she's a very quiet person, she's patient,"" Merkel biographer Bollmann told CNN.     The early years of Merkel's chancellorship were largely uneventful. Germany's economy slowly gained steam after years of stagnation. But in 2008, when investment banking company Lehman Brothers collapsed and the world seemed headed for an economic abyss, Germans feared their export-dependent nation could go under.   That's when Merkel took charge, becoming the country's crisis manager.   On October 5, 2008, she told Germans: ""Your savings are secure, the federal government guarantees that."" Her calm, reassuring words helped to prevent a run on the banks and marked the start of a period of confidence in the face of adversity for Germany, led by Merkel.  Her government started a short-term labor program, known as ""Kurzarbeit,"" which helped companies keep their employee on staff by making them work shorter hours, while the government supplemented their incomes.  The program cost around 6 billion euros, according to the Federal Employment Agency, but it helped Germany avoid mass unemployment and ensured that German companies were at an advantage once the global economy picked up, since they had retained their skilled workforces.  By the time the Greek debt crisis hit in 2012, Germans had faith in their chancellor, trusting that she could handle the adversity.  Merkel took charge, creating giant funds to save not just Greece's economy but those of other debt-ridden Eurozone nations as well. Though Greece and other countries criticized what they saw as the draconian terms of their bailouts, Merkel likely saved the single currency.  ""Europe will fail if the euro fails. Europe wins if the euro wins,"" Merkel told the German Bundestag in 2012.   ""She has led Germany, Europe and, in parts, the rest of the world through an era of crises -- big crises -- which we never thought could happen in a Western democracy,"" says Bollmann.  But while Merkel is seen as a bold and accomplished crisis manager, critics say she risked alienating the conservative voter base of her own party, the CDU, by taking left-of-center positions on key topics including nuclear energy, foreign policy and immigration.   Merkel's government had initially halted Germany's planned exit from nuclear energy, but she reversed that decision in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in 2011. The move was popular with those on the left, but not necessarily with CDU supporters.  ""The phenomenon of Angela Merkel is basically leading from behind,"" said Julian Reichelt, managing editor of Germany's largest daily tabloid newspaper, the right-leaning BILD. ""You see where people are going and you follow the masses, you don't lead the masses. She was brilliant at doing that.""

""Angela Merkel tried to ignore all major conflicts and problems all over the world as good as she could. She was one of the champions of ignoring all the problems that were so obvious in Afghanistan and which would obviously hit us after the withdrawal.""  Arguably, Merkel's highest-profile moment of international leadership came in the summer of 2015 when hundreds of thousands of refugees, mostly displaced by the civil war in Syria, made their way to Europe.   While many of her fellow leaders across the European Union argued in favour of trying to stop the masses from entering thebloc, Merkel believed that the moment called for a huge humanitarian response.    ""Germany is a strong country. We have achieved so much -- we can do it!"" Merkel famously said at a press conference in 2015, opening her country's doors to the refugees. ""We will manage this, and if something stands in the way, it must be overcome.""  Angela Merkel poses for a selfie with Anas Modamani, a refugee from Syria on September 10, 2015 in Berlin, Germany. Germany eventually welcomed an estimated 1.2 million refugees over the next year and a half. Hajo Funke, a professor at Berlin's Freie University, believes opening Germany and Europe up to the influx of people in need was one of the greatest humanitarian acts in German history. ""This was a golden hour of the post-World War II democracy. This is the legacy: To be non-nationalist,"" Funke told CNN.    In the wake of Merkel's call to action, many Germans welcomed the asylum seekers with food and clothes; some opened their homes to those who had made the arduous journey, or helped them find work.But the magic of the moment eventually wore off. Integrating the new arrivals was a tricky task some critics say was handled poorly.  Her handling of the refugee crisis put a dent in Merkel's popularity at home and helped fuel the rise of far-right political forces including the Alternative for Germany (AfD). The AfD became the first far-right group elected to the Bundestag since 1961. It came third in the 2017 election, with 12.6% of the vote.  While Merkel did win another term as chancellor, poor showings for her party at local elections convinced her it was time for change; in 2018 she announced that she would hand over the leadership of the CDU, and that she would not seek re-election in 2021.  But a new crisis soon came knocking.   In early 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, Merkel was one of the first world leaders to acknowledge the scale of the health threat posed by coronavirus.   ""Since German unification, no, since the Second World War there has not been a challenge to our nation that required us to act in solidarity with one another so much,"" she said.  Merkel receives a medal from Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of the World Health Organization, during the opening of a WHO hub in Berlin on September 1, 2021. Under her leadership, Germany quickly introduced a strict lockdown, reinstated the ""Kurzarbeit"" program to protect the economy, and helped launch the search for a vaccine.  Merkel's handling of the pandemic saw her popularity spike, as Germans once again learned to appreciate the dogged resolve of their often-underestimated leader.  Some are left doubting whether those lining up to take her place as chancellor will match up to their predecessor.""The question is: Who's going to replace (Merkel), and will that person have the same charisma and ability that she did?"" Ben Schreer, from the International Institute for Strategic Studies' (IISS) wondered in an interview with CNN earlier this week. ""Allies are skeptical, and Germans as well are quite cautious in that regard.""Laschet, Scholz and Baerbock can perhaps take some comfort from the fact that pundits and politicians alike once doubted Merkel's abilities too.As the politician who arrived on the scene as an inexperienced ""Maedchen"" prepares to leave the world stage, Germany's voters are left wondering who will fill the void left by the woman they came to know affectionately as ""Mutti"": the mother of the nation."

And it's even rarer as a professional, as Suriname's Vice President Ronnie Brunswijk finds himself at the advanced athletic age of 60. Suriname is a South American country with a population of nearly 600,000, but Brunswijk has just taken time out from his vice-presidential duties to captain the club that he owns, Inter Moengotapoe, in a CONCACAF League match, a second-tier international club competition akin to UEFA's Europa League. Inter eventually lost 6-0 against Honduran side CD Olimpia on Tuesday, according to the official CONCACAF match report. Brunswijk has been Suriname's vice-president since July 2020.Brunswijk ""made history by becoming the oldest player, at 60 years of age, to play in an international club competition,"" according to ESPN. But it's not just his exploits on the pitch that's raising eyebrows; it's what allegedly happened after the game that has led to CONCACAF launching a formal investigation. Read MoreIn a video shared on social media, Brunswijk appears to be handing out cash bills to people in the CD Olimpia locker room, before leaving with a shirt of the Honduran club.In a statement sent to CNN, CONCACAF said it was ""extremely concerned at the content of a video circulating on social media which raises potential integrity issues surrounding the Concacaf League match between Inter Moengotapoe and CD Olimpia. ""The matter is being referred to the Concacaf Disciplinary Committee who will commence a formal investigation and a further update will be provided when that process has concluded."" 'We did our job'Brunswijk had pulled on the number 61 shirt for the club that he owns, but his involvement in the match has also raised questions as to whether he had disrespected the competition. CD Olimpia player Johnny Leverón spoke to the press following the game, saying that each team is free to make whatever decision they think is best. ""It's a situation for our opponents, we don't get involved in that,"" said Leverón, who said he thought a lot of attention was being paid to Brunswijk's appearance.The Guianas: South America's 'Lost World' rediscovered""Like I said, today we did our job,"" he added.  A journalist also asked Gustavo Reggi, CD Olimpia assistant coach, if he felt disrespected by Brunswijk's appearance.

CNN has contacted CD Olimpia, Inter Moengotapoe, CONCACAF and the office of the Surinamese Vice President for comment. Suriname is a former Dutch colony which gained independence in 1975. Brunswijk has a widely reported backstory, including a conviction in the Netherlands for drug trafficking, but became vice-president in July 2020. The Dutch court system did not immediately respond to CNN's request for more details about the conviction. ""Everything I have, I give it to the people,"" Brunswijk told the  New York Times in January. ""Ever since I was a child, I wanted to help others. I now have the chance to help the whole country.""

F1 boss Domenicali says Monaco GP format to be cut to three days,"(CNN)A historic change is on the horizon for Formula One's jewel in the crown, with the Monaco Grand Prix format set to be cut to three days next season.Traditions held since the first official championship in 1950 have dictated that practice sessions in Monaco are held on Thursday, leaving the typical practice day of Friday free for festivities in line with a Christian holiday and extending the overall format to four days.However, F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali has exclusively told CNN Sport that Monaco's schedule for the 2022 calendar will be shortened to the conventional three day format.""Monaco will be in three days, straight away,"" Domenicali told Amanda Davies.""So Friday, Saturday and Sunday instead of Thursday, hold, and then Saturday and Sunday. That's the change we're going to introduce next year,"" Domenicali added.Read MoreMonaco's unique tradition of a four-day schedule has added to its aura as one of the flagship races on the F1 calendar, complementing the narrow street-circuit's glamorous reputation and scenic setting, as well as the Grand Prix's prestigious history.Originally in place to observe the Christian holiday of Ascension Day, a bank holiday in the principality, the pausing of the race program for Friday has traditionally opened the day up for off-track festivities and parties -- a unique occasion amplified by a typically bustling celebrity presence.In a statement to CNN, Richard Micoud -- the Communications and Media Manager of the Automobile Club de Monaco (ACM), organizers of the Monaco GP -- said, ""It [Monaco GP 2022] will be a 3-day event for F1 and a 4-day event for ACM. The Thursday will be dedicate [sic] to support races. Our organization is actually working on the 4-day timing who will be available soon on our website.""Domenicali's revelation regarding Monaco is set to be one of the central discussion points in relation to the 2022 calendar, which the CEO said would be announced at the FIA World Motor Sport Council meeting in Paris on October 15th.  Domenicali, who took over from former F1 CEO Chase Carey ahead of the current season, said that the plan was to have 23 races in 2022 -- assuring France was among the hosts -- but did not confirm reports suggesting South Africa is to return to the schedule via the Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit.Brazil's Ayrton Senna at the South African Grand Prix at Kyalami in March 1993.""We received interest from Kyalami to be back in the calendar,"" Domenicali said.""Of course, we have discussed with them in order to see if they are ready from the technical perspective, the financial perspective, to be inserted in the calendar, so discussions are there.""We have received other requests from other countries in Africa ... in this moment, I need to keep it confidential,"" Domenicali added.In December, the Jeddah Street Circuit will host Saudi Arabia's inaugural F1 race, though the landmark occasion approaches amidst allegations of human rights abuses and 'sportswashing' -- a phenomenon whereby corrupt or autocratic regimes invest in sports events to whitewash their international reputation.A rendering from Formula One shows the Jeddah Street Circuit looking north.Prince Khalid Bin Sultan Al Faisal, president of the Saudi Automobile and Motorcycle Federation (SAMF), told CNN in September that F1 ""would never have agreed to come"" if they had concerns over the impact of the country hosting a race on the organization's ""reputation.""In response to questions regarding Saudi Arabia's human rights issues, Domenicali said he believed F1 could serve as a ""facilitator"" for change.""The beauty of the sport is that we need to talk about sport. In our culture, the human rights are crucial and important to be followed,"" Domenicali said.""We believe that with Formula One in the country, there's no scope or space not to think the truth. We are going to be facilitators, to anticipate the change that maybe in a different situation would have taken a longer time.JUST WATCHEDSaudi Arabia to host maiden F1 Grand Prix, but human rights threaten to overshadow country's global sporting ambitionsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSaudi Arabia to host maiden F1 Grand Prix, but human rights threaten to overshadow country's global sporting ambitions 04:33""On the other side, we cannot expect to switch in a blink of an eye, a change of a millennium, thousands of years of culture in something.""I don't want to be political, but I think that that's the beauty of the sport to make sure that they can really prove that they [Saudi Arabia] really want to change,"" Domenicali added.Having led Ferrari as team principal from 2008 until his resignation in 2014, Domenicali has seen his former employers fall behind the leading pack in the 2021 season, with Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes locked in a tense battle for the World Championship. Verstappen holds a five point lead over seven-time champion Hamilton heading into this weekend's Russian Grand Prix in Sochi, the pair's first race since a dramatic Italian Grand Prix at Monza that saw the two rivals collide. The crash, which saw Verstappen's car land on top of the Brit's, ruled both drivers out of the remainder of the contest, with Hamilton telling reporters after the race that he felt ""fortunate to be alive.""Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes, collide at the Italian Grand Prix, Monza.Content to now be taking a rear view seat for proceedings, Domenicali believes the rivalry can only be a good thing for the sport.""You know what is beautiful because you don't feel the pressure that I'm sure that both Lewis and Max have a feeling behind the visor and also Toto [Wolff] and Christian [Horner], when they're acting as team principal,"" Domenicali said.""It is great because they are putting on a great show for the people. The limit is getting higher and higher. And the more we go up to the end of the season ... there's a sporting fight at the maximum intensity, not only for them, but also for the team.""The situation that happened in Monza was related to the fact that both were in a position where if everything was perfectly done, it was not there. So everyone is pushed up to the limit. It would be interesting to see, hopefully, up to the last race.Max Verstappen, Lewis Hamilton and Daniel Ricciardo celebrate on the podium following the Malaysia Grand Prix in 2017.""The good thing is that every time they would be close, everyone will try to think what the others are thinking: 'Who is stronger? Do I need to give up or not?' That's incredible in terms of tension,"" Domenicali said.On the decision of the race stewards to give Verstappen a three-place grid penalty due to his part in the crash, Domenicali said it was ""important to respect the role of the steward."""

","europe, Long-lost letter reveals heroic story of Polish farmer who saved Jewish sisters from Nazis - CNN",Long-lost letter reunites families of two Jewish sisters and the Polish farmer who saved them from the Nazis,"(CNN)As a child growing up in Sweden, Karolina Jurzyk didn't pay much attention to her grandfather's tales of wartime Poland. Now, however, thanks to a long-forgotten letter, Jurzyk, 35, has uncovered the truth about how her family rescued and hid two Jewish sisters from the Nazis. Having moved to Stockholm as a baby, Jurzyk grew up hearing from her grandparents about her great-grandfather's bravery -- though details were scant. ""I was very close to my grandparents,"" she told CNN. ""I spent every school holiday with them in Poland and World War II was very present because they both survived it.""Jadwiga (L) and Fela (R) wrote to Jurzyk's great-grandfather after the war to thank him for saving their lives.Her grandfather, Stanislaw Jurzyk, told her that in 1942, aged 12, while playing on the family farm in Gostchorz -- a village about 68 miles east of Warsaw -- he stumbled across two women, both in their 20s.Read MoreShocked, he told his parents, who revealed that they had been hiding the sisters since finding them in their fields.""They were badly beaten and very weak,"" Karolina Jurzyk, who works as a pattern maker for H&M in Stockholm, told CNN. According to her grandfather, the sisters were orphaned -- but they spoke little of their past.Stanislaw was sworn to secrecy by his father -- also called Stanislaw. That same year, his mother, Helena, died in childbirth -- leaving Stanislaw Senior to raise the children alone, while still protecting the women. Under the Nazi regime, anyone found to be hiding Jews risked severe punishment -- including the death penalty -- if captured.  Stanislaw Jurzyk Senior and his wife Helena, with their daughter Alina and baby son, also named Stanislaw 

Courtesy Karolina JurzykJurzyk didn't know her great-grandfather, who died in 1989, and her surviving relatives knew nothing about the sisters' fate after they left the farm two years later. But when her father, Wojciech, 60, recently discovered a letter, her interest was sparked. Tattered and scrawled in old Polish, it was almost impossible to decipher the correspondence that her grandfather had sometimes talked about.One thing was clear, however: The correspondents' names -- Fela and Jadzia Kejzman. Jurzyk, who until then had only known the women's first names, ventured online for clues. The letter was recently discovered by Jurzyk's father, but the old-style Polish made it hard to decipher.A simple online search returned both sisters' namesBoth names appeared on genealogy site MyHeritage. Excited and nervous, Jurzyk messaged the family tree's host. Karen Norman, 42, a New York-based real estate agent, replied. She is the granddaughter of Jadzia, whose full given name was Jadwiga. Anne Frank memorial vandalized with swastikasNorman knew of the rescue but in even less detail than Jurzyk, as, like many Holocaust survivors, her grandmother and great-aunt rarely spoke of their experiences or their early lives growing up in Poland. What she could share, however, was that both sisters raised families in North America; her grandmother in Toronto, while Fela -- short for Felicia -- settled in Chicago. ""I had tears in my eyes, I was so glad to hear they survived,"" said Jurzyk. The families and MyHeritage now hope to apply to Yad Vashem -- the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Jerusalem -- to have Stanislaw Jurzyk Sr. recognized as Righteous Among the Nations. The process is complex but if successful, the official honor would see him rank among other gentiles who risked much to save Jews during the war -- among them Oskar Schindler, Raoul Wallenberg and Miep Gies, who helped hide Anne Frank.Karolina Jurzyk went in search of the Jewish sisters her great-grandparents had rescued.Poignant timingThe timing of the discovery is all the more poignant as both families were bereaved over the past year. While Norman's grandmother died several years ago,her great-aunt, Fela, only passed away in December, aged 103. A German man's Nazi grandfather took over a Jewish man's store. He tracked down his descendants to apologizeAnd Jurzyk's grandfather, Stanislaw, died in March after suffering from dementia. He lived long enough to hear the news, however.""My grandfather apparently became very emotional,"" Jurzyk told CNN, as he learned from his son, Jurzyk's father, that the connection with the sisters' family had been made.  ""Somewhere deep inside he knew they were safe."" Although she regrets not acting sooner, Jurzyk says connecting with Norman has eased the loss of her grandfather's death.""I feel our ancestors had such a huge connection and it's almost as if I have been a part of it as well. ""I'm not a very spiritual person but somehow I feel their energy with me and it's comforting -- it's like he's saying ... 'you're doing a good job.'"" Karen Norman with her great-aunt, who was known as Fela and who died in December  aged 103.When MyHeritage heard the story they had the letter professionally translated.Addressed to Stanislaw Senior, it was dated February 10, 1948 and sent from a displaced persons camp in Bamberg, within the US-controlled part of Germany. They wrote: ""A lot of time has passed since the day we said goodbye to you. However, we did not express our cordial thanks to you for all the good that you did for us. We will never forget this noble act of saving our life."" The women described Jurzyk's great-grandfather as ""a person who has done the best and grandest act of saving human life"" and expressed their ""most profound gratitude.""They talked of ""a new stage in life"" on ""blood-soaked German soil,"" but outlined plans to emigrate ""beyond Europe's borders.""The story behind the German Jewish war hero honored on both sides of the Atlantic, decades apartFela appears to have physically written the letter, saying her sister married and had a baby, while she has ""a much-loved husband.""She adds: ""My husband already knows you from my accounts and he has asked me to send you his regards and a handshake.""Signing off, she expresses her intention to stay in touch, saying ""the bond of our friendship should be unbreakable.""Second letter emergesMore recently, Jurzyk's father uncovered another letter in his own father's belongings. In this one, dated November 22, 1949, Fela says she and her husband arrived in the United States after a treacherous sea crossing. She explains that her sister and family remain in Germany but hope to leave soon.An emotional Norman told CNN that hearing from Jurzyk ""felt like a sign."" ""When I got the message it was the most incredible thing and the saddest at the same time. I really believe it was my great-aunt sending us a sign.""Karolina Jurzyk with her grandfather Stanislaw, who discovered the sisters in hiding when he was 12. He died earlier this year.Norman said she first joined MyHeritage to try to find answers about the sisters' past. ""Everything was a mystery. We don't know how they ended up being there or where they were going to. There were bits and pieces we knew but they told us very little.""  Norman has not come across any letters in reply, but she hasn't yet gone through all of her great-aunt's belongings. ""Even though there isn't a lot of information in the letters, it still makes me cry reading them. Just knowing how much Mr. Jurzyk meant to her,"" Norman said. 'They lived because of him'So far, the two women have only communicated through online messages, but they hope to speak on the phone soon.Ho Feng Shan: The 'Chinese Schindler' who saved thousands of Jews""I would not be here if it wasn't for her great-grandfather,"" said Norman. ""They lived because of him. Someone who just saw them as people and worthy of saving. How do you thank someone's family for something like that generations later?""Many people researching their family history see the Holocaust as a ""black hole,"" but evolving technology provides ""the opportunity to overcome what was once a critical lack of information"", according to MyHeritage researcher Nitay Elboym.""We believe stories of rescue are particularly important, because they inspire us to do what's right on a human level, even when it means taking extraordinary risks,"" he said."

","europe, UNGA: Submarine spat with France casts shadow over Biden's address - CNN",EU official says 'something is broken' with US ties as sub spat casts shadow over Biden's UN address ,"(CNN)Tensions between European leaders and the White House over a scuppered submarine deal threatened to overshadow President Joe Biden's address to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, with one EU official saying ""something is broken"" in the transatlantic alliance. The French government has been seething since last week, when Australia abandoned a huge deal to buy conventional submarines from France. Instead, the US and UK announced they would help Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines as part of a new security pact called AUKUS. The move has opened a new fissure in the Western alliance and sparked growing public criticism from other European officials. Thierry Breton, the EU commissioner for internal markets, said in an interview with CNN on Monday that ""something is broken between our relations in Europe and the US."" Breton warned there was a ""growing feeling"" in Europe over past few weeks and there had been a ""lack of trust and confidence between allies.""Read More""I'm here again to make sure that we rebuild this partnership, even if in some areas we may need to pause and reset it,"" he added.Explainer: Australia's nuclear-powered submarine deal is fueling anger in the country. Here's whyFrance reacted with fury to news of the new pact on Thursday, and that Australia was abandoning its $65 billion deal to buy French-built, conventionally powered submarines. In the wake of the deal, France recalled its ambassadors from Washington and Canberra, and asked the EU to reconsider Australia's bid for a free-trade deal with the bloc.While Biden has asked for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron in an attempt to smooth relations, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Tuesday he would not speak with Macron during the UN this week. ""That is not an opportunity for that at this time. I'm sure that opportunity will come in time. But right now, I understand the disappointment,"" Morrison said.Macron will not be in New York for the UN General Assembly and will not send a pre-recorded address, a spokesperson confirmed to CNN Tuesday. He had originally been slated to deliver a pre-recorded statement. White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Monday that Biden and Macron had agreed to speak ""in the coming days."" In announcing the deal last Wednesday, Biden said AUKUS would reinforce alliances and it marks a major step toward countering China. But the trilateral partnership has alienated key European allies and now the bloc is calling for answers over France's treatment. In an exclusive interview with CNN on Monday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said ""a lot of questions"" must be answered when it comes to the breakdown of the French-Australian submarine deal.Inside the creation of the US-Australia submarine deal""One of our member states has been treated in a way that is not acceptable, so we want to know what happened and why,"" von der Leyen said, adding that the situation must be clarified ""before you keep on going with business as usual.""Speaking from New York where she is attending the UN General Assembly, von der Leyen went on to say that the EU ""will step up"" to build its defense.""Many of our member states are members of NATO, and NATO is the strongest military alliance in the world, but it is important to have a strong European pillar in NATO, and to have for the European Union the capabilities to act independently in theaters where for example NATO is not, but the EU is called upon,"" she told Amanpour.Von der Leyen is among a number of EU officials to express solidarity with France in recent days.""The European solidarity and the support for France was very clear,"" among EU leaders, France's Minister of State for European Affairs, Clément Beaune, said on Tuesday of comments from the EU Commission president, the president of the EU Council and the EU's high representative for foreign affairs."

""It was a valuable point for Granada at the Camp Nou, where whistles were heard.""Another headline in rival paper Diario Sport simply said: ""Koeman, more alone than ever.""""The approach against Granada and the result leave the coach on a tightrope,"" it read, highlighting also that, under Koeman, Barcelona has failed to win in five of its last eight La Liga matches, stretching back to the end of last season.As he tried to defend the recent results, Koeman is quoted in Sport as saying: ""This is not the Barça of eight years ago. People will be unhappy with the result, but not with the attitude the team has shown.Ronald Koeman looked dejected at full time.""If you see today's list, if you see the [player] call-up ... do you think you have to play 'tiki-taki?'"" he questioned, referencing the style favored by ex-Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola.It was certainly a far cry from the tiki-taka of old, as Barça put in an incredible 45 crosses into the box from open play -- though, in the end, it was the style that broke Granada's resistance.But Koeman arguably has a point.Barcelona's perilous financial position, caused by years of mismanagement and scattergun spending, has left the Dutchman with a hodgepodge group of youngsters -- talented, certainly, but hardly in the ideal circumstances to grow and flourish -- and veterans.The likes of Philippe Coutinho and the permanently injured Ousmane Dembele, two of Barcelona's three most expensive signings in history, are a constant reminder of the frivolousness that got the club into this position.Ronald Araujo celebrates his equalizing goal.Perhaps it's a sign of how far Barca has fallen that the players celebrated a last-minute equalizer against Granada, a team without a win so far this season, as ecstatically as they did. The draw lifts Barcelona to seventh place in La Liga, five points behind league leader and bitter rival Real Madrid but with a game in hand."

The biennial golf tournament which pits the world's best golfers head-to-head in a Europe vs. US format kicks off on Friday, September 24 at Whistling Straits, Wisconsin.Delayed a year due to the coronavirus pandemic, the tournament will be composed of its usual foursome, fourball and singles format in front of a partisan US crowd hoping their players can return the trophy to American soil after Europe last won in 2018 in France. US captain Steve Stricker and Europe captain Pádraig Harrington have selected strong sides, stocked to the brim with major winners and current and former world No. 1's and even an Olympic gold medalist. So three years after ""Moliwood"" -- the pairing of Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, which took golf by storm and led to one of the sport's most viral videos with the two of them in bed with the trophy -- who will be the competition's next break out player? Read MoreWill Team USA reclaim the trophy or can Europe make sure it will be joining them on the flight back over the Atlantic?READ: The power of three: How Arnold Palmer, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus revolutionized golfA view of the Ryder Cup Trophy at Whistling Straits Golf Course.Meet the teamsFor the home team, Stricker had almost an embarrassment of riches to select from when it came time to make his picks. Collin Morikawa, Dustin Johnson, Bryson DeChambeau, Brooks Koepka, Justin Thomas and Patrick Cantlay all automatically qualified based on points earned from performances over the past two years. That's 10 major titles and three FedExCup titles between the six of them. In addition to those, Stricker selected Jordan Spieth, Xander Schauffele, Harris English, Scottie Scheffler, Daniel Berger and Tony Finau.That's an additional three majors, 26 PGA Tour victories and one Olympic gold medal to add to the team. The biggest name to miss out for Team USA was Patrick Reed, the 2018 Masters winner, which was a ""very difficult call,"" according to Stricker. But finding the balance between rookies and veterans and players that fit the Whistling Straits course was paramount for Stricker and his assistant captains. ""We are looking to the best players to perform here at Whistling Straits, and these six guys that we picked, we feel like fit Whistling Straits to a T,"" he told the media. ""We have done some analysis of those rookies since 2008, and US rookies are a 40-29-17 record in Ryder Cup. So rookies fare very well in this type of form, and we're excited to have these rookies. Some of them aren't really rookies. They have played in past Presidents Cup teams. Some of these guys have match play competition under their belt as well and other events that they played.""There is also the matter of rivalries bubbling inside the US team, most notably the frosty relationship between Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau.There is little love lost between the pair with their minor spats often spilling over onto social media. The moment Koepka rolled his eyes when DeChambeau walked behind him at this year's PGA Championship perhaps perfectly sums up their strained relationship.But both have previously said their rivalry is good for golf and Stricker does not anticipate it being a problem during the Ryder Cup.   ""It's a non-issue, really, for me and the team. We got together a few weeks ago, the six of us and I've had conversations with them both,"" Stricker said. ""They have assured me it's not going to be an issue. I have no worries whatsoever.""""Will we pair them together? I don't think so at this point but things could change. Could always happen. But probably not. ""But again, I had a dinner; they all showed up. We had great conversation, great talks. So I'm not seeing it as an issue at all and they are completely on board.""Stricker (left) and Harrington (right) pose with the Ryder Cup.A European advantage? For the European team, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, Paul Casey, Rory McIlroy, Viktor Hovland, Tyrrell Hatton, Lee Westwood, Matt Fitzpatrick and Bernd Wiesberger all earned automatic qualification based on the world and European points lists.Ian Poulter, Sergio Garcia and Shane Lowry were selected by Harrington as he completed his 12-man team to take on Stricker and the Americans. ""I'm really happy with my team,"" Harrington said during the announcement. ""It's a great team for foursomes and fourball play, a lot of good ball-strikers and it's a team going to Whistling Straits that is well-suited to the golf course. It's a strong, well-rounded and very balanced team.""Whistling Straits is a course that harks back to golf's British and Irish heritage. Based on the shore of Lake Michigan, the course is ""defined by the open, rugged and windswept terrain,"" the course's website says. Designed by legendary golf course designers Pete and Alice Dye, it offers ""throwbacks to the raw freshness of Ireland."" As well as the US Senior Open, the course has hosted the PGA Championship on three occasions over the last 17 years. On each occasion, it was won by a non-American: Fiji's Vijay Singh (2004), Germany's Martin Kaymer (2010) and Australia's Jason Day (2015).Could the challenges the course offers up -- with strong winds and unforgiving rough -- be one that the European team are more accustomed to facing and therefore more prepared to overcome?Even Stricker called the course a ""tremendous test"" for his players, but he believes he's picked the right ones for the job. ""You can get some big winds here or breezes off Lake Michigan, and it's going to be a challenge for all the guys and there's birdies to be made out there but there's also danger that lurks around every corner. I think it's going to be a tremendous place to have this event.""A view from 17th hole of Whistling Straits Golf Course.Might not have been here For some, their golfing careers might not have taken off if it wasn't for the Ryder Cup. For world no. 1 Jon Rahm, the 1997 Ryder Cup held in his home country of Spain was the introduction to golf his father and, by proxy, he had. Captained by legendary Spanish golfer Seve Ballesteros, the European team retained the trophy at the Valderrama Golf Club in the resort of Sotogrande in Spain. Rahm's father and his friends traveled to the course to watch Europe win by a narrow 14.5-13.5 margin and returned with a desire to try the game for themselves. ""They thought it was a really cool atmosphere, very unique event in sport, and when they got back home they said: 'Oh, let's try this,'"" Rahm told CNN Sport's Alex Thomas.

So I guess because of the Ryder Cup and Seve and a lot of other people in Spain is why my family is playing off, why I'm here.""With his maiden major victory under his belt and sitting atop golf's rankings, Rahm is aiming for a more positive result than he registered at the 2018 Ryder Cup, winning only one of his three matches.Will it be the stars and stripes of the US or the dark blue of Europe which drapes the Ryder Cup? Will the star-studded US team be able to shine or will Europe's team spirit once again be decisive? One thing is for certain: the European team have to deal with a bear-pit of an atmosphere in Wisconsin if they have any hopes of retaining the famous trophy."
